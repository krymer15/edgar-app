For information regarding our revenue by geographic area, and property and equipment by geographic area, please see “Note 14 – Segment and Geographic Information” in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. See “Risk Factors” under Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the risks associated with our international operations.Customers, Sales and Marketing Our target customers are original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) and original design manufacturers, both of which design and manufacture end market devices, and distributors for these products. We seek to strategically align our sales force along key customer lines in order to offer fully integrated platforms to our customers. In this way, we believe we can more effectively offer a broader set of content into our key customers’ end products, without having multiple product groups separately engage the same customer. We seek to complement and support our direct sales force with manufacturers’ representatives for our products in North America. In addition, we have contracted with distributors who support our sales and marketing activities in the United States, Europe and Asia. We also use third-party logistics providers who maintain warehouses in close proximity to our customers’ facilities. We expect that a significant percentage of our sales will continue to come from direct sales to key customers.We use field application engineers to provide technical support and assistance to existing and potential customers in designing, testing and qualifying systems designs that incorporate our products. Our marketing team works in conjunction with our field sales and application engineering force, and is organized around our product groups.Net revenue attributable to significant customers including both distributor and direct customers whose revenues represented 10% or more of total net revenue is presented in the following table:*Less than 10% of net revenue.Net revenue attributable to Distributor A increased in fiscal 2025 and 2024 as they support customers in the data center end market, which has continued to experience robust demand.We continue to monitor the creditworthiness of our distributor and direct customers, and believe the distributors’ sales to diverse end customers and geographies further serve to mitigate our exposure to credit risk.8Table of ContentsInventory and Working CapitalWe typically place firm orders with our suppliers up to 26 weeks prior to the anticipated delivery to our customer and may make further supply commitments up to 52 weeks to secure capacity. Occasionally, orders may be placed in advance of receiving a binding order from our customers. To secure capacity over the long term, we have entered into and expect to continue to enter into capacity reservation arrangements with certain foundries and substrate partners. We often maintain substantial inventories to meet short lead time orders for multi-year product runs.Research and DevelopmentWe believe that our future success depends on our ability to introduce improvements to our existing products and to develop new products that deliver cost-effective solutions for both existing and new markets. Our research and development efforts are directed largely to the development of high-performance analog, mixed-signal, digital signal processing and accelerated compute circuits based on known microprocessor architectures with highest performance and lowest power consumption. We devote a significant portion of our resources to expanding our product portfolio based on a broad intellectual property portfolio with designs that are intended to enable high-performance, reliable communications over a variety of physical transmission media. We are also focused on incorporating functions currently provided by stand-alone integrated circuits into our integrated platform solutions to reduce our customers’ overall system costs. Our portfolio of products is based on foundational intellectual property on leading edge Advanced CMOS processes in 5nm and 3nm. Our development will also include state-of-the-art improvements of available process technologies in 2nm and below geometries which includes gate all around transistor architecture and new innovations leveraging back side power. Advanced packaging technologies are also critical for reducing and optimizing overall system costs. Advanced packaging techniques like Chip on Wafer on Substrate (“CoWoS”), Integrated fanout (“InFo”) along with advanced substrates, thermal solutions enable large 2.5D/3D/3.5D interposers for complex accelerated compute ASICs.We have assembled a core team of engineers who have experience in the areas of complementary metal oxide semiconductor (“CMOS”) technology, digital signal processing, electro-optics, embedded microprocessors, mixed-signal circuit design, silicon photonics, and system-level architectures. We have invested and expect to continue to invest a significant amount in research and development. See our discussion of research and development expenses in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.ManufacturingIntegrated Circuit FabricationThe vast majority of our integrated circuits are fabricated using available CMOS processes, which is intended to provide greater flexibility to engage independent foundries to manufacture integrated circuits at lower costs. By outsourcing manufacturing, we are able to avoid the cost associated with owning and operating our own manufacturing facilities. This is intended to allow us to focus our efforts on the design and marketing of our products. We seek to work closely with our foundry partners to forecast on a monthly basis our manufacturing capacity requirements. We also seek to closely monitor foundry production to help ensure consistent overall quality, reliability and yield levels. Our integrated circuits are currently fabricated in several advanced manufacturing processes. Because more precise manufacturing processes are expected to lead to enhanced performance, smaller silicon chip size and lower power requirements, we continually seek to evaluate the benefits and feasibility of migrating to smaller geometry process technology in order to reduce cost and improve performance.Assembly and TestWe typically outsource all product packaging and testing requirements for our products in production to several assembly and test subcontractors primarily located in Taiwan, Canada, Korea, Singapore and China. The subcontractor location varies as we are party to several contracts with the U.S. government, federal prime contractors, and federal subcontractors that prohibit or otherwise restrict production, assembly and testing in foreign countries or by certain foreign entities.9Table of ContentsGovernmental RegulationsImport/Export, National Security and Other Regulations Related to International Operations and OwnershipWe are subject to laws and regulations worldwide, which may differ among jurisdictions, affecting our operations in areas including, but not limited to: intellectual property ownership and infringement; tax; import and export requirements; anti-corruption; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; conflict minerals; data privacy requirements; competition; advertising; employment; product regulations; environment, health and safety requirements; and consumer laws. For example, government export regulations apply to the encryption or other features contained in some of our products.A portion of the business we acquired in our Avera acquisition in fiscal 2021 requires facility security clearances under the National Industrial Security Program. The National Industrial Security Program requires that a corporation maintaining a facility security clearance be effectively insulated from foreign ownership, control or influence (“FOCI”). Because we were organized in Bermuda at the time of the Avera acquisition, we entered into agreements with the U.S. Department of Defense with respect to FOCI mitigation arrangements that relate to our operation of the portion of the Avera business involving facility clearances. After our domestication, we requested and have now received partial release from some of these obligations. The remaining measures and arrangements may materially and adversely affect our operating results due to the increased cost of compliance with these measures. If we fail to comply with our obligations under these agreements, our ability to operate our business may be adversely affected.Primarily as a result of our acquisition of Avera, we are now a party to certain contracts with the U.S. government, federal prime contractors and federal subcontractors. Our contracts with these government entities are subject to various procurement regulations and other requirements relating to their formation, administration and performance. These regulations and requirements include supply chain restrictions that may prohibit the sourcing of materials, supplies, or services from foreign entities including those located in or organized in China.See “Risk Factors” under Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on regulatory matters. Environmental ManagementWe are also subject to environmental rules and regulations in multiple jurisdictions, such as the European Union (“EU”) Directive on Restriction of Hazardous Substances (“RoHS”), the EU Regulation, Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals SVHC Substances Directive, the EU Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (“WEEE Directive”), China’s regulation on Management Methods for Controlling Pollution Caused by Electronic Information Products, and California Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986.We believe that our products comply with the current Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive, the European legislation that restricts the use of a number of substances, including lead, and the Regulation, Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals SVHC Substances Directive. In addition, each of our manufacturing subcontractors certifies to us compliance with ISO 14001:2015, the international standard related to environmental management. We are also working with our suppliers in the responsible sourcing of “conflict minerals” such as cobalt, tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold.Intellectual Property Our future revenue growth and overall success depend in large part on our ability to protect our intellectual property (“IP”). We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, contractual provisions, confidentiality agreements and licenses to protect our intellectual property. As of February 1, 2025, we have over 10,000 issued patents and pending patent applications in the United States and other countries, covering various aspects of our technology. The expiration of our patents ranges from 2025 to 2045, and none of the patents expiring in the near future are expected to be material to our IP portfolio as we are not substantially dependent on any single patent or group of related patents. While we believe the duration of our patents generally covers the expected lives of our products, our patents may not collectively or individually cover every feature on innovation in our product. In addition, our efforts may not be sufficient to protect our intellectual property from misappropriation or infringement. See “Risk Factors” under Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the risks associated with our intellectual property.We have expended and expect to continue to expend considerable resources in establishing a patent position designed to protect our intellectual property. While our ability to compete is enhanced by our ability to protect our intellectual property, we believe that in view of the rapid pace of technological change, the combination of the technical experience and innovative skills of our employees may be as important to our business as the legal protection of our patents and other proprietary information.10Table of ContentsFrom time to time, we may desire or be required to renew or to obtain licenses from third parties in order to further develop and effectively market commercially viable products or in connection with a pending or future claim or action asserted against us. We cannot be sure that any necessary licenses will be available or will be available on commercially reasonable terms.The integrated circuit industry is characterized by vigorous pursuit and protection of intellectual property rights, which has resulted in significant and often time consuming and expensive litigation. From time to time, we receive, and may continue to receive in the future, notices that claim we have infringed upon, misappropriated or misused the proprietary rights of other parties.In addition, we have in the past and may in the future be sued by other parties who claim that we have infringed their patents or misappropriated or misused other intellectual property rights, or who may seek to invalidate one or more of our patents, trademarks, or other rights. Although we defend these claims vigorously, it is possible that we will not prevail in pending or future lawsuits. See “Risk Factors” under Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and “Note 8 – Commitments and Contingencies” in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part II, Item 8, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of the risks associated with patent litigation matters.Competition The markets for our products are intensely competitive, and are characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, frequent new product introductions and pricing pressures. Competition has intensified as a result of the increasing demand for higher levels of performance, integration and smaller process geometries. We expect competition to further intensify as current competitors strengthen the depth and breadth of their product offerings, either through in-house development or by acquiring existing technology. In addition, some of our customers have chosen to develop certain semiconductor products internally and this trend may continue to proliferate. We believe that our ability to compete successfully in the rapidly evolving markets for our products depends on multiple factors, including, but not limited to:•the performance, features, quality and price of our products;•the development execution, timing and success of enhanced and new product introductions by us, our customers and our competitors;•the emergence, rate of adoption and acceptance of new industry standards;•market demand trends;•competitive tactics;•our ability to obtain adequate foundry capacity with the appropriate technological capability; and•the number and nature of our competitors in a given market.Companies that compete directly with our businesses include, but are not limited to, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (“AMD”), Alchip Technologies (“Alchip”), Alphawave Semi (“Alphawave”), Astera Labs, Inc., Broadcom Inc. (“Broadcom”), Cisco Systems, Inc. (“Cisco”), Credo Technology Group Holding Ltd, Intel Corporation, Global Unichip Corporation (“GUC”), MACOM Technology Solutions Holdings, Inc., MediaTek Inc., Microchip Technology Inc., Montage Technology, Nvidia Corporation, NXP Semiconductors N.V., Phison Electronics Corporation, Qualcomm Incorporated (“Qualcomm”), Rambus, Inc., Realtek Semiconductor Corporation, Semtech Corporation, Silicon Motion Technology Corporation, and Socionext Inc. We expect increased competition in the future from both emerging and established companies, as well as from alliances among competitors, customers or other third parties, any of which could acquire significant market share. See “Risk Factors” under Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of competitive risks associated with our business.We expect that the average unit selling prices of our products will continue to be subject to significant pricing pressures. In order to offset expected declines in the selling prices of our products, we will need to continue to introduce innovative new products and attempt to reduce the cost to design and manufacture our products. To accomplish this, we intend to continue to implement design changes that lower the cost of manufacturing, assembly and testing of our products. See “Risk Factors” under Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of pricing risks.11Table of ContentsSustainabilityBy integrating environmental and social considerations into our operations, supply chain and product design, we aim to deliver innovative semiconductor solutions that reduce impacts throughout our full value chain and meet customer expectations. Our sustainability initiatives are a corporate priority and supported by our Board of Directors and leadership team.

The Executive Compensation Committee provides oversight of our human capital, including compensation philosophy, policies and programs. The Nominating and Governance Committee has general oversight of the Company’s approach to sustainability as it relates to human capital. The Audit Committee has oversight of business risks and ethics and compliance programs, which are connected to human capital and workplace issues. Marvell annually conducts talent reviews and succession planning and the Board receives updates regularly from senior management on succession planning, management talent assessment, attrition and employee survey results. Our executive management team also reviews our human capital initiatives and our progress on such initiatives. The Company employed 7,042 people as of February 1, 2025. Our employees sit across three geographical regions: 50% of employees are based in the Americas, 39% are in APAC (which includes India) and 11% are in EMEA.Marvell’s Core Behaviors lay the foundation of our culture and are centered around four key aspects:•Act with integrity and treat everyone with respect,•Innovate to solve customer needs,•Execute with thoroughness and rigor, and•Help others achieve their objectives.Our efforts to attract, develop, engage and retain employees, as well as our efforts to embed inclusion across the Company, reinforce these behaviors. Our Core Behaviors also serve as a roadmap to help integrate employees as we grow through hiring and acquisitions.Attracting and Retaining the Best TalentWe continue to invest in attracting and recruiting the best talent from across the world. By developing new sourcing strategies, we are striving for continuous flow of talent, despite the competitive market in technical talent. Our annual internship program has been a strong source of talent for our company. We also attract a diverse workforce through our university recruiting program, which helps us hire students across all degree levels from a number of universities around the world. This strategy helps provide us with a diversity of knowledge and unique approaches to solving technological challenges.We are actively focused on retaining our people through our rewards, benefits, employee engagement and development programs, as well as by fostering an inclusive culture where our employees feel appreciated and purposeful. We are committed to offering our employees a comprehensive benefits package, competitive compensation, a range of wellness offerings, flexibility in hybrid work options and a safe work environment.Our efforts at retention also include measuring and evaluating employee turnover rates. Our global voluntary turnover rate for fiscal 2025 was approximately 5%.12Table of ContentsGrowing and Developing Our PeopleMarvell gives employees the opportunity to have an outsized impact and play a significant role in developing innovative technologies, while continuously advancing their careers. We value everyone's unique perspectives, ideas and skills to help us solve problems, deliver on our current and future business priorities and develop innovative products that meet our customer’s needs. We have a variety of offerings, including workshops, coaching and mentoring programs and other learning resources.To help our employees develop their careers outside their core area of expertise, we also have our Employee Mobility Policy in place, which makes it easier to transfer to different open positions within the Company.InclusionAt Marvell, we strive to create a workplace where every employee, regardless of background, feels respected and valued for who they are as an individual. This is a Core Behavior that guides our work. We also believe that an inclusive culture brings unique value to the work we do, as individuals and as a company.Building a Great Place to WorkOur goal is to help our employees thrive and advance in a supportive environment designed to foster wellbeing and unlock creativity and innovation. This includes providing competitive benefits, aligned with employee input, to help cultivate and sustain wellness across all areas of life.Everyone deserves a safe workplace and this includes our employees, contractors and visitors. We recognize the importance of preventing and addressing any risks that may occur. As our operations primarily include offices and engineering labs, we are focused on injury and illness prevention, emergency preparedness, fire and life safety, ergonomics and lab safety. Fostering Organizational and Team HealthNurturing the health of our company and teams starts with listening to and engaging with our employees globally. Recognizing that listening to our employees is critical to identifying opportunities to enhance our culture, we consistently look for new ways to solicit employees’ feedback. We also measure levels of engagement through our annual Voice of the Employee Survey, which helps us better understand employee needs and opportunities for improvement, and to develop action plans to address them.Climate ChangeAddressing climate change-related issues is an important priority for Marvell and our stakeholders, in particular our customers.Management is responsible for formulating and executing our climate strategy. Marvell also runs an executive-level Sustainability Committee to provide senior leadership and strategic guidance on sustainability, as well as Sustainability Working Groups who are responsible for gathering data, setting strategy and goals, and supporting disclosure efforts on material sustainability topics. Marvell’s Chief Operating Officer (the “COO”) is the executive sponsor of the Thriving Organization - Environment Working Group and has overall responsibility at the executive level for climate strategy across our facilities globally. The COO is responsible for assessing and leading the management of climate-related risks and opportunities, elevating stakeholder concerns and guiding the implementation of climate-related policies, programs and disclosures. The COO is also a member of the Sustainability Committee. The COO works closely with the Chief Legal Officer, who ultimately raises the issue to the Board as part of its sustainability updates, both in the Nominating and Governance Committee’s quarterly updates and in the periodic updates to the Board of Directors.Recognizing that downstream Scope 3 product-use emissions represent the largest component of our emissions profile, we are focusing on product power efficiency. Power optimization is not just essential for tackling our carbon footprint — it is a business imperative. Our customers demand products that allow them to consume less power for more performance. Although power has always been part of our innovation and R&D process, this has become an even greater priority for the company. We are also working collaboratively with our suppliers around greenhouse gas emission reduction to build climate resilience and to drive decarbonization at a value chain level, impacting the emissions of both our suppliers and customers. 13Table of ContentsItem 1A. Risk FactorsInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the material risks and uncertainties described below and all information contained in this report before you decide to purchase our common stock. Many of these risks and uncertainties are beyond our control, including business cycles and seasonal trends of the computing, infrastructure, semiconductor and related industries and end markets. A manifestation of any of the following risks and uncertainties could, in circumstances we may or may not be able to accurately predict, render us unable to conduct our business as currently planned and materially and adversely affect our reputation, business, prospects, financial condition, cash flows, liquidity and operating results. In addition, the trading price of our common stock could decline due to the occurrence of any of these risks, and you could lose all or part of your investment. It is not possible to predict or identify all such risks and uncertainties; our operations could also be affected by risks or uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations. Therefore, you should not consider the following discussion to be a complete statement of all the potential risks or uncertainties that we face.SUMMARY OF FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT OUR FUTURE RESULTSThe following summarizes the principal factors that make an investment in the Company speculative or risky. This summary should be read in conjunction with the remainder of this “Risk Factors” section and should not be relied upon as an exhaustive summary of the material risks facing our business. The occurrence of any of these risks could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or growth prospects or cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements we have made in this report and those we may make from time to time. You should consider all of the risk factors described in our public filings when evaluating our business.•risks related to our ability to design, develop and introduce new and enhanced products, in particular in the Artificial Intelligence (“AI”), Cloud and 5G markets, in a timely and effective manner, as well as our ability to anticipate and adapt to changes in technology;•risks related to our dependence on a few customers for a significant portion of our revenue, particularly as our major customers comprise an increasing percentage of our revenue, as well as risks related to a significant portion of our sales being concentrated in the data center end market, and risks related to the gain or loss of design wins with our key customers;•risks related to changes in general macroeconomic conditions such as economic slowdowns, inflation, stagflation, high or rising interest rates, financial institution instability, and recessions; •risks related to tariffs and trade restrictions with China, Russia and other foreign nations including risks related to the ability of our customers, particularly in jurisdictions such as China that may be subject to trade restrictions (including the need to obtain export licenses) to develop their own solutions, vertically integrate which may reduce the need for our products, or acquire fully developed solutions from third parties; •risks related to our ability to execute on changes in strategy and realize the expected benefits from restructuring activities;•risks related to cancellations, rescheduling or deferrals of significant customer orders or shipments, as well as the ability of our customers to manage inventory;•risks related to our ability to successfully integrate and to realize anticipated benefits or synergies, on a timely basis or at all, in connection with our past, current, or any future acquisitions, divestitures, significant investments or strategic transactions;•risks related to the highly competitive nature of the end markets we serve, particularly within the semiconductor and infrastructure industries;•risks related to our ability to maintain a competitive cost structure for our manufacturing, assembly, testing and packaging processes and our reliance on third parties to produce our products;•risks related to our ability to attract, retain and motivate a highly skilled workforce, especially engineering, managerial, sales and marketing personnel;•risks related to any current and future litigation, regulatory investigations, or contractual disputes with customers that could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources that are needed to successfully maintain and grow our business;•risks related to our ability to scale our business;14Table of Contents•cybersecurity risks;•risks related to our debt obligations;•risks related to the extension of lead time due to supply chain disruptions, component shortages that impact the costs and production of our products and kitting process, and constrained availability from other electronic suppliers impacting our customers’ ability to ship their products, which in turn may adversely impact our sales to those customers;•risks related to the specific conditions in the end markets we address, including seasonality and volatility in the technology sector and semiconductor industry;•risks related to failures to qualify our products or our suppliers’ manufacturing lines;•risks related to failures to protect our intellectual property, particularly outside the United States;•risks related to the potential impact of significant events or natural disasters or the effects of climate change (such as drought, flooding, wildfires, increased storm severity, sea level rise, and power outages), particularly in certain regions in which we operate or own buildings, such as Santa Clara, California, and where our third-party manufacturing partners or suppliers operate, such as Taiwan and elsewhere in the Pacific Rim;•risks related to our sustainability programs;•risks related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or other future pandemics, on the global economy and on our customers, suppliers, employees and business; and•risks related to failures of our customers to agree to pay for NRE (non-recurring engineering) costs, failure to pay enough to cover the costs we incur in connection with NREs or non-payment of previously agreed NRE costs due to us.Our quarterly results of operations have fluctuated in the past and could do so in the future. Because our results of operations are difficult to predict, you should not rely on quarterly comparisons of our results of operations as an indication of our future performance. Due to fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations and other factors, the price at which our common stock will trade is likely to continue to be highly volatile. Accordingly, you may not be able to resell your common stock at or above the price you paid. In future periods, our stock price could decline if, among other factors, our revenue or operating results are below our estimates or the estimates or expectations of securities analysts and investors. Our stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker symbol “MRVL”. As a result of stock price volatility, we may be subject to securities class action litigation. Any litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources that are needed to successfully maintain and grow our business.CHANGES IN PRODUCT DEMAND CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTSUnfavorable or uncertain conditions in the AI, Cloud and 5G markets may cause fluctuations in our rate of revenue growth or financial results.World-wide markets for our AI, Cloud and 5G products may not evolve in the manner or in the time periods we anticipate. If domestic and global economic conditions worsen, overall spending on our AI, Cloud and 5G products may be reduced, which would adversely impact demand for our products in these markets. In addition, unfavorable developments with evolving laws and regulations worldwide related to these products and suppliers may limit global adoption, impede our strategy, and negatively impact our long-term expectations in this area. Even if the AI, Cloud and 5G markets evolve in the manner or in the time periods we anticipate, if we do not have timely, competitively priced, market-accepted products available to meet our customers’ need in these markets, we may miss a significant opportunity and our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, as a result of the fact that the markets for AI, Cloud and 5G are still evolving, demand for these products may be unpredictable and may vary significantly from one period to another. In addition, these markets may not develop as anticipated if AI training and inference costs drop dramatically due to customer adoption of less expensive alternative technologies. See also, “Our sales are concentrated in a few large customers. If we lose or experience a significant reduction in sales to any of these key customers, if any of these key customers experience a significant decline in market share, or if any of these customers experience significant financial difficulties, our revenue may decrease substantially and our results of operations and financial condition may be harmed.” See also, “Adverse changes in the political, regulatory and economic policies of governments in connection with trade with China and Chinese customers have reduced the demand for our products and damaged our business” for additional risks related to export restrictions that may impact certain customers in the AI, Cloud and 5G markets.15Table of ContentsOur sales are concentrated in a few large customers. If we lose or experience a significant reduction in sales to any of these key customers, if any of these key customers experience a significant decline in market share, or if any of these customers experience significant financial difficulties, our revenue may decrease substantially and our results of operations and financial condition may be harmed.We receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers which are comprised of both distributors and direct customers. For example, during fiscal 2025, there were two customers (one distributor and one direct customer) whose revenues represented 10% or more of total net revenue. In addition, net revenue from our ten (10) largest customers, inclusive of our distributor and direct customers, represented 81% of our total net revenue for the fiscal year ended February 1, 2025. Sales to our largest customers have fluctuated significantly from period to period and year to year and will likely continue to fluctuate in the future, primarily due to the timing and number of design wins with customers, the continued diversification of our customer base as we expand into new markets, adverse changes in the political and economic policies of the U.S. or other governments (such as changes in export policies), and natural disasters or other issues. The loss of any of our large customers or a significant reduction in sales we make to them would likely harm our financial condition and results of operations. For example, some of our large customers depend on rapid and continuous innovation and will select partners who can help them deliver innovation at their pace and if we are unable to deliver on these timelines we may miss significant business opportunities. To the extent one or more of our large customers experience financial challenges, bankruptcy or insolvency, this could have a material adverse effect on our sales and our ability to collect on receivables, which could harm our financial condition and results of operations. See also, “Note 2 – Significant Accounting Policies - Concentration of Credit Risk and Significant Customers” of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information on our significant customers for the current reporting period.If we are unable to increase the number of large customers in key markets, then our operating results in the foreseeable future would be expected to continue to depend on sales to a relatively small number of customers, as well as the ability of these customers to sell products that incorporate our products. In the future, these customers may decide not to purchase our products at all, purchase fewer products than they did in the past, or alter their purchasing patterns in some other way, particularly because:•a significant portion of our sales are made on a purchase order basis, which allows our customers to cancel, change or delay product purchase commitments with relatively short notice to us;•customers may purchase similar products from our competitors;•customers may discontinue sales or lose market share in the markets for which they purchase our products;•customers, particularly in jurisdictions such as China that may be subject to trade restrictions or tariffs, may develop their own solutions, vertically integrate which may reduce the need for our products, or acquire fully developed solutions from third-parties; or•customers may be subject to severe business disruptions, including, but not limited to, those driven by recessions, financial instability, actual or threatened public health emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, other global or regional macroeconomic developments, or natural disasters.In addition, there has been a trend toward customer consolidation in the semiconductor industry through business combinations, including mergers, asset acquisitions and strategic partnerships (for example, Cisco acquired Acacia Communications in 2021). Mergers or restructuring among our customers, or their end customers, could increase our customer concentration with a particular customer or reduce total demand as the combined entities reevaluate their business and consolidate their suppliers. Such future developments, particularly in those end markets that account for more significant portions of our revenues, could harm our business and our results of operations.In addition, we may be unable to negotiate as favorable terms with larger customers whether those customers resulted from customer consolidation, merger integrations or other reasons, and any such less favorable terms could harm our business and our results of operations.Given their dependence on semiconductor products to operate their data centers and to ensure continuity of supply and reduce direct costs, some large customers may begin developing and making their own semiconductor solutions which could result in a loss of business for Marvell.16Table of ContentsIn addition, our sales have recently been, and in the future may continue to be, concentrated in our data center end market. Sales into this end market have fluctuated significantly from period to period and year to year and will likely continue to fluctuate in the future. Customers in this end market may decide in the future not to purchase our products at all, purchase fewer products than they did in the past, or alter their purchasing patterns in some other way. A significant reduction in sales to this end market would greatly reduce our revenues and harm our financial condition and results of operations. Please see “Note 3 – Revenue” of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a more detailed description of sales into our data center end market.We face risks related to recessions, inflation, stagflation and other macroeconomic conditions.Customer demand for our products may be impacted by weak macroeconomic conditions, inflation, stagflation, recessionary or lower-growth environments, high or rising interest rates, equity market volatility or other negative economic factors in the U.S. or other nations. For example, under these conditions or expectation of such conditions, our customers may cancel orders, delay purchasing decisions or reduce their use of our services. In addition, these economic conditions have resulted in the past, and could result in the future, in higher inventory levels and the resulting excess capacity charges from our manufacturing partners if we need to slow production to reduce inventory levels. Further, in the event of a recession or threat of a recession our manufacturing partners, suppliers, distributors, and other third-party partners may suffer their own financial and economic challenges and as a result they may demand pricing accommodations, delay payment, or become insolvent, which could harm our ability to meet our customer demands or collect revenue or otherwise could harm our business. Similarly, disruptions in financial and/or credit markets may impact our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our manufacturing partners, customers, suppliers and creditors and might cause us to not be able to continue to access preferred sources of liquidity when we would like, and our borrowing costs could increase. Thus, if general macroeconomic conditions, or conditions in the semiconductor industry, or conditions in our customer end markets deteriorate or experience a sustained period of weakness or slower growth, our business and financial results could be materially and adversely affected.In addition, we are also subject to risk from inflation and increasing market prices of certain components, supplies, and commodity raw materials, which are incorporated into our end products or used by our manufacturing partners or suppliers to manufacture our end products. These components, supplies and commodities have from time to time become restricted, or general market factors and conditions have in the past and may in the future affect pricing of such components, supplies and commodities (such as inflation or supply chain constraints). See also, “Our gross margin and results of operations may be adversely affected in the future by a number of factors, including decreases in our average selling prices of products over time, shifts in our product mix, or price increases of certain components or third-party services due to inflation, supply chain constraints, or for other reasons.”We are subject to order and shipment uncertainties. If we are unable to accurately predict customer demand, we may hold excess or obsolete inventory, which would reduce our gross margin. Conversely, we may have insufficient inventory or be unable to obtain the supplies or contract manufacturing capacity to meet demand, which would result in lost revenue opportunities and potential loss of market share as well as damaged customer relationships.We typically sell products pursuant to purchase orders rather than long-term purchase commitments. Some of our customers have, and others may in the future, cancel or defer purchase orders on short notice without incurring a significant penalty. In addition, customers who have purchase commitments may not honor those commitments. Due to their inability to predict demand or for other reasons, during the last few years some of our customers have accumulated excess inventories and, as a consequence, they either have deferred or they may defer future purchases of our products. We cannot accurately predict what or how many products our customers will need in the future. Anticipating demand is difficult because our customers face unpredictable demand for their own products and are increasingly focused more on cash preservation and tighter inventory management.We place orders with our suppliers based on forecasts of customer demand and, in some instances, may establish buffer inventories to accommodate anticipated demand. Our forecasts are based on multiple assumptions, each of which may introduce error into our estimates. For example, our ability to accurately forecast customer demand may be impaired by the delays inherent in our customer’s product development processes, which may include extensive qualification and testing of components included in their products, including ours. In many cases, they design their products to use components from multiple suppliers. This creates the risk that our customers may decide to cancel or change product plans for products incorporating our semiconductor solutions prior to completion, which makes it even more difficult to forecast customer demand. In addition, while many of our customers are subject to purchase orders or other agreements that do not allow for cancellation, there can be no assurance that these customers will honor these contract terms and cancellation of these orders may adversely affect our business operations and demand forecast which is the basis for us to have products made.17Table of ContentsOur products are incorporated into complex devices and systems, which creates supply chain cross-dependencies. Due to cross dependencies, supply chain disruptions have in the past and may in the future negatively impact the demand for our products. We have a limited ability to predict the timing of a supply chain correction. As we have a broad product portfolio and diversified products with many different SKUs, significant supply chain disruptions will cause us to have more work-in-process inventories that we hold to provide us with more flexibility to support our customers. If we cannot predict future customer demand or supply chain disruptions, then we may hold excess or obsolete inventory. Moreover, significant supply chain disruption may negatively impact the timing of our product shipments and revenue shipment linearity which may impact and extend our cash conversion cycle. In addition, the market share of our customers could be adversely impacted on a long-term basis due to any protracted supply chain disruption, which could negatively affect our results of operations. See also, “We rely on our manufacturing partners for the manufacture, assembly, testing and packaging of our products, and the failure of any of these third-party vendors to deliver products or otherwise perform as requested or to be able to fulfill our orders could damage our relationships with our customers, decrease our sales and limit our ability to grow our business” for additional information on the impacts of supply chain cross-dependencies on our business.If we overestimate customer demand, our excess or obsolete inventory may increase significantly, which would reduce our gross margin and adversely affect our financial results. The risk of obsolescence and/or excess inventory is heightened for semiconductor solutions due to the rapidly changing market for these types of products. Conversely, if we underestimate customer demand or if insufficient manufacturing capacity is available, we would miss revenue opportunities and potentially lose market share and damage our customer relationships. In addition, any future significant cancellations or deferrals of product orders or the return of previously sold products could materially and adversely affect our profit margins, increase product obsolescence and restrict our ability to fund our operations.We operate in intensely competitive markets. Our failure to compete effectively would harm our results of operations.The semiconductor industry is extremely competitive. We currently compete with a number of large domestic and international companies in the business of designing semiconductor solutions and related applications, some of which have greater financial, technical and management resources than us. In addition, efforts to introduce new products into markets with entrenched competitors will expose us to additional competitive pressures. For example, we are facing, and expect we will continue to face, significant competition in the infrastructure, cloud and data center and networking markets. Additionally, customer expectations and requirements have been evolving rapidly. For example, customers now expect us to provide turnkey solutions and commit to future roadmaps that have technical risks.Some of our competitors may be better situated to meet changing customer needs and secure design wins. Increasing competition in the markets in which we operate may negatively impact our revenue and gross margins. For example, competitors with greater financial resources may be able to offer lower prices than us, or they may offer additional products, services or other incentives that we may not be able to match.We also may experience discriminatory or anti-competitive practices by our competitors that could impede our growth, cause us to incur additional expense or otherwise negatively affect our business. In addition, some of these competitors may use their market power to dissuade our customers from purchasing from us.In addition, many of our competitors operate and maintain their own fabrication facilities and have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, larger customer bases, and greater sales, marketing and distribution resources than we do.Moreover, the semiconductor industry has experienced increased consolidation over the past several years. For example, Renesas Electronics Corporation acquired Dialog Semiconductor in August 2021, Analog Devices acquired Maxim Integrated Products in 2021, AMD acquired Xilinx, Inc. in February 2022 and Pensando Systems in May 2022, Qualcomm acquired Veonner in April 2022, and Broadcom acquired VMware in November 2023. Consolidation among our competitors has led, and in the future could lead, to a changing competitive landscape, capabilities and market share, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage and harm our results of operations.18Table of ContentsOur gross margin and results of operations may be adversely affected in the future by a number of factors, including decreases in our average selling prices of products over time, shifts in our product mix, or price increases of certain components or third-party services due to inflation, supply chain constraints, or for other reasons.The products we develop and sell are primarily used for high-volume applications. While prices of our products have increased at times due to inflation and additional costs resulting from securing an increase in supply, the prices of our products have historically decreased. We expect that the average unit selling prices of our products will continue to be subject to significant pricing pressures. In addition, our more recently introduced products tend to have higher associated costs because of initial overall development and production expenses. Therefore, over time, we may not be able to maintain or improve our gross margin. Our financial results could suffer if we are unable to offset any reductions in our average selling prices by other cost reductions through efficiencies, introduction of higher margin products and other means.To attract new customers or retain existing customers, we may offer certain price concessions to certain customers, which could cause our average selling prices and gross margin to decline. In the past, we have reduced the average selling prices of our products in anticipation of future competitive pricing pressures, new product introductions by us or by our competitors and other factors. We expect to continue to have to reduce prices of existing products in the future. Moreover, because of the wide price differences across the markets we serve, the mix and types of performance capabilities of our products sold may affect the average selling prices of our products and have a substantial impact on our revenue and margin. We may enter new markets in which a significant amount of competition exists, and this may require us to sell our products with lower gross margin than we earn in our established businesses. If we are successful in growing revenue in these markets, our overall margin may decline. Fluctuations in the mix and types of our products may also affect the extent to which we are able to recover the fixed costs and investments associated with a particular product, and as a result may harm our financial results.Additionally, because we do not operate our own manufacturing, assembly, testing or packaging facilities, we are not able to reduce our costs as rapidly as companies that operate their own facilities and our costs may even increase, which could also reduce our gross margin. Our margin could also be impacted for example by the following factors: increased costs (including increased costs caused by tariffs, inflation, higher interest rates, or supply chain constraints); loss of cost savings if parts ordering does not correctly anticipate product demand or if the financial health of either our manufacturers partners or our suppliers deteriorates; excess inventory, or inventory holding and obsolescence charges. In addition, we are subject to risks from fluctuating market prices of certain components, which are incorporated into our products or used by our suppliers to manufacture our products. Supplies of these components may from time to time become restricted, or general market factors and conditions such as inflation or supply chain constraints have in the past affected, currently affect and may in the future affect pricing of such commodities. For example, during the first few quarters of fiscal 2023 supply shortages in the semiconductor industry of multi-layer complex substrates, IC packaging capacity and fab constraints resulted in increased lead times, inability to meet demand, and increased costs. Any increase in the price of components used in our products will adversely affect our margin.We may enter into new markets, including markets with different business models, as a result of our acquisitions or for other reasons that may reduce our gross margin and operating margin. For example, for certain products we use an ASIC model to offer end-to-end solutions for intellectual property, design team, fab and packaging to deliver a tested, yielded product to customers. This business model tends to have a lower gross margin. In addition, the costs related to this type of business model typically include significant NRE costs that customers pay based on the completion of milestones. Our operating margin may decline if our customers do not agree to pay for NREs, if they do not pay enough to cover the costs we incur in connection with NREs, or non-payment of previously agreed NRE costs. In addition, our operating margin may decline if we are unable to sell products in sufficient volumes to cover the development costs that we have incurred. In addition, the ASIC business model requires us to use third-party intellectual property and we may lose business or experience reputational harm if third parties, including customers, lose confidence in our ability to protect their intellectual property rights. With respect to risks related to our use of third-party intellectual property, see also, “We have been named as a party to several legal proceedings and may be named in additional ones in the future, including litigation involving our patents and other intellectual property, which could subject us to liability, require us to indemnify our customers, require us to obtain or renew licenses, require us to stop selling our products or force us to redesign our products.”19Table of ContentsWE ARE VULNERABLE TO PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND MANUFACTURING-RELATED RISKSWe rely on our manufacturing partners for the manufacture, assembly, testing and packaging of our products, and the failure of any of these third-party vendors to deliver products or otherwise perform as requested or to be able to fulfill our orders could damage our relationships with our customers, decrease our sales and limit our ability to grow our business.We do not have our own manufacturing, assembly or packaging facilities and have very limited in-house testing facilities. Therefore, we currently rely on several third-party manufacturing partners to produce our products. We also currently rely on several third-party assembly, testing and packaging subcontractors to assemble, package and test our products. This exposes us to a variety of risks, including the following:Regional ConcentrationMost of our products are manufactured by third-party foundries located in Taiwan, and other sources are located in China, Germany, South Korea, Singapore and the United States. In addition, most of our third-party assembly, testing and packaging facilities are located in China, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan and Canada. Because of the geographic concentration of most of these third-party foundries, as well as most of our assembly, testing and packaging subcontractors, we are exposed to the risk that their operations may be disrupted by regional events including, for example, droughts, earthquakes (particularly in Taiwan and elsewhere in the Pacific Rim close to fault lines), tsunamis or typhoons, severe storms, power outages, or by actual or threatened public health emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic and future pandemics, or by political, social or economic instability, or by geopolitical tensions and conflicts. For example, we were impacted by COVID outbreaks in Asia in the first half of fiscal 2023 that resulted in closed factories, clogged ports and a shortage of workers as officials imposed lockdowns and mass testing requirements. In the case of such an event, our revenue, cost of goods sold and results of operations may be negatively impacted. In addition, there are limited numbers of alternative foundries capable of producing advanced technologies and identifying and implementing alternative manufacturing facilities would be time consuming. Although there is a movement in the U.S. to build more foundries locally and the U.S. government is providing funds or other incentives for certain companies to do so, we do not expect that such foundries will be available to us to produce certain types of advanced technologies any time soon, if ever. If we need to utilize alternate manufacturing facilities, either in Taiwan or elsewhere we could experience significant expenses and delays in product shipments, which could harm our results of operations.No Guarantee of Capacity or SupplyThe ability of each of our manufacturing partners to provide us with materials and services is limited by its available capacity and existing obligations. When demand is strong, availability of our partners’ capacity may be constrained or not available, and with certain exceptions, our vendors are not obligated to perform services or supply products to us for any specific period, in any specific quantities, or at any specific price, except as may be provided in a particular purchase order. We place our orders on the basis of our customers’ purchase orders or our forecast of customer demand, and most of our manufacturing partners can allocate capacity to the production of other companies’ products and reduce deliveries to us on short notice. It is possible that their customers that are larger and better financed than we are or that have long-term agreements with our main foundries may induce them to reallocate capacity to those customers. Most of our manufacturing partners may reallocate capacity to their customers offering them a better margin or rate of return than provided by us. This reallocation could impair our ability to secure the supply of components that we need. Moreover, if any of our third-party manufacturing partners or other suppliers are unable to secure the necessary raw materials from their suppliers, lose benefits under material agreements, experience power outages or labor shortages, or lack sufficient capacity to manufacture our products, encounter financial difficulties or suffer any other disruption or reduction in efficiency, we may encounter supply delays or disruptions, which could harm our business or results of operations.There are a very limited number of foundries and consolidation of the foundries that provide services to us or to the semiconductor industry due to bankruptcy or through business combinations, including mergers, asset acquisitions and strategic partnerships may adversely impact us. A foundry, supplier or other manufacturing partner could become unavailable to us if it is acquired by a competitor or a large company that may change the scope of the offerings. Or a foundry may not be suitable for us if it does not invest in, or have the ability to manufacture, advanced technologies. In particular, as we and others in our industry transition to smaller geometries, our manufacturing partners may be supply constrained or may charge premiums for these advanced technologies, which may harm our business or results of operations. See also, “We may experience increased actual and opportunity costs as a result of our transition to smaller geometry process technologies.” In addition, a foundry or supplier may become unavailable to us as a result of economic or political instability. Any disruption to our manufacturing partners could result in a material decline in our revenue, net income and cash flow. 20Table of Contents We have in the past including in the first few quarters of fiscal 2023, and may in the future, experience a number of industry-wide supply constraints affecting the type of high complexity products we provide for data infrastructure. These supply constraints have impacted, and in the future may impact, the kitting process for our products. These supply challenges have in the past, and may in the future, limit our ability to fully satisfy demand for some of our products.While we attempt to create multiple sources for our products, most of our products are not manufactured at more than one foundry at any given time, and our products typically are designed to be manufactured in a specific process at only one of these foundries. Accordingly, if one of our foundries is unable to provide us with components as needed, it would be difficult for us to transition the manufacture of our products to other foundries, and we could experience significant delays in securing sufficient supplies of those components. Any disruption to our foundry partners could result in a material decline in our revenue, net income and cash flow. In addition, our assembly testing and packaging partners may be single sourced and it may be difficult for us to transition to other manufacturing partners for these services.In order to secure sufficient capacity when demand is high and to mitigate the risks described in the foregoing paragraph, we have entered into, and in the future may enter into, various arrangements with certain manufacturing partners or other suppliers that could be costly and harm our results of operations, such as nonrefundable deposits with, or loans to, such parties in exchange for capacity commitments, or contracts that commit us to purchase specified quantities of components over extended periods. We may not be able to make such arrangements in the future in a timely fashion or at all, and any arrangements may be costly, reduce our financial flexibility, and not be on terms favorable to us. Moreover, if we are able to secure capacity, we may be obligated to use all of that capacity or incur penalties. These penalties may be expensive and could harm our financial results.During the first few quarters of fiscal 2023, supply shortages in the semiconductor industry of multi-layer complex substrates, IC packaging capacity, and specific wafer process node constraints resulted in increased lead times, inability to meet demand, and increased costs. Because of the geographic concentration of some of these suppliers, we are exposed to the risk that their operations may be disrupted by regional events including droughts, earthquakes (particularly in Taiwan and elsewhere in the Pacific Rim close to fault lines), tsunamis or typhoons, severe storms, power outages, or by actual or threatened public health emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic, or by political, social or economic instability. In addition, while the Russian invasion of Ukraine has not had a direct material impact on us due to our limited sales to Russia and Ukraine, we are unable to predict the indirect impact this conflict will have on us due to impacts on the supply chain, global and domestic economies, interest rates and stock markets. Moreover, while Israel’s declaration of war on Hamas, a U.S. designated Foreign Terrorist Organization, and current armed conflict in Israel and the Gaza Strip is not expected to have a material impact on us, we are unable to predict the full impact this conflict will have on us or our operations in Israel due to impacts on the supply chain, global and domestic economies, interest rates and stock markets.Uncertain Yields and QualityThe fabrication of our products is a complex and technically demanding process. Our manufacturing partners have from time to time experienced manufacturing defects and lower manufacturing yields, which are difficult to detect at an early stage of the manufacturing process and may be time consuming and expensive to correct. Changes in manufacturing processes or the inadvertent use of defective or contaminated materials by our foundries could result in lower than anticipated manufacturing yields or unacceptable performance. In addition, we may face lower manufacturing yields and reduced quality in the process of ramping up and diversifying our manufacturing partners. Poor yields from our partners, or defects, integration issues or other performance problems with our products could cause us significant customer relations and business reputation problems, harm our financial performance and result in financial or other damages to our customers. Our customers could also seek damages in connection with product liability claims, which would likely be time consuming and costly to defend. In addition, defects could result in other significant costs. See also, “Costs related to defective products could have a material adverse effect on us.”Because we rely on outside manufacturing partners, we have a reduced ability to directly control product delivery schedules and quality assurance, which has in the past and may in the future result in product shortages or quality assurance problems that delay shipments or increase costs.Commodity PricesWe are also subject to risk from increasing or fluctuating market prices of certain commodity raw materials, including gold and copper, which are incorporated into our end products or used by our suppliers to manufacture our end products. Supplies for such commodities have from time to time become restricted, or general market factors and conditions have in the past affected and may in the future affect pricing of such commodities (such as inflation or supply chain constraints).21Table of ContentsWe may experience increased actual and opportunity costs as a result of our transition to smaller geometry process technologies.In order to remain competitive, we have transitioned, and expect to continue to transition, our semiconductor products to increasingly smaller line width geometries. We periodically evaluate the benefits, on a product-by-product basis, of migrating to smaller geometry process technologies. We also evaluate the costs of migrating to smaller geometry process technologies including both actual costs such as increased mask costs and wafer costs and increased costs related to EDA (electronic design automation) tools and the opportunity costs related to the technologies we choose to forego. These transitions are imperative for us to be competitive with the rest of the industry and to target some of our product development in high growth areas to these advanced nodes, which has resulted in significant initial design and development costs.We have been, and may continue to be, dependent on our relationships with our manufacturing partners to transition to smaller geometry processes successfully. We cannot ensure that the partners we use will be able to effectively manage any future transitions. In addition, there are a very limited number of foundries capable of producing advanced technologies, and identifying and implementing alternative manufacturing facilities would be time consuming. If we or any of our partners experience significant delays in a future transition or fail to efficiently implement a transition, we could experience reduced manufacturing yields, delays in product deliveries and increased expenses, all of which could harm our relationships with our customers and our results of operations.As smaller geometry processes become more prevalent, we expect to continue to integrate greater levels of functionality, as well as customer and third-party intellectual property, into our products. However, we may not be able to achieve higher levels of design integration or deliver new integrated products on a timely basis, if at all. Moreover, even if we are able to achieve higher levels of design integration, such integration may have a short-term adverse impact on our results of operations, as we may reduce our revenue by integrating the functionality of multiple chips into a single chip.We rely on our customers to design our products into their systems, and the nature of the design process requires us to incur expenses prior to customer commitments to use our products or recognizing revenues associated with those expenses which may adversely affect our financial results.One of our primary focuses is on winning competitive bid selection processes, known as “design wins,” to develop products for use in our customers’ products. We devote significant time and resources in working with our customers’ system designers to understand their future needs and to provide products that we believe will meet those needs and these bid selection processes can be lengthy. If a customer’s system designer initially chooses a competitor’s product, it becomes significantly more difficult for us to sell our products for use in that system because changing suppliers can involve significant cost, time, effort and risk for our customers. Thus, our failure to win a competitive bid can result in our foregoing revenues from a given customer’s product line for the life of that product. In addition, design opportunities may be infrequent or delayed. Our ability to compete in the future will depend, in large part, on our ability to design products to ensure compliance with our customers’ and potential customers’ specifications. We expect to invest significant time and resources and to incur significant expenses to design our products to ensure compliance with relevant specifications.We often incur significant expenditures in the development of a new product without any assurance that our customers’ system designers will select our product for use in their applications. We often are required to anticipate which product designs will generate demand in advance of our customers expressly indicating a need for that particular design. Even if our customers’ system designers select our products, a substantial period of time will elapse before we generate revenues related to the significant expenses we have incurred.The reasons for this delay generally include the following elements of our product sales and development cycle timeline and related influences:•our customers usually require a comprehensive technical evaluation of our products before they incorporate them into their designs;•it can take from six months to three years from the time our products are selected to commence commercial shipments; and•our customers may experience changed market conditions or product development issues.22Table of ContentsThe resources devoted to product development and sales and marketing may not generate material revenue for us, and from time to time, we may need to write off excess and obsolete inventory if we have produced product in anticipation of expected demand. We may spend resources on the development of products that our customers may not adopt. If we incur significant expenses and investments in inventory in the future that we are not able to recover, and we are not able to compensate for those expenses, our operating results could be adversely affected. In addition, if we sell our products at reduced prices in anticipation of cost reductions but still hold higher cost products in inventory, our operating results would be harmed.Additionally, even if system designers use our products in their systems, we cannot assure you that these systems will be commercially successful or that we will receive significant revenue from the sales of our products for those systems. As a result, we may be unable to accurately forecast the volume and timing of our orders and revenues associated with any new product introductions.We have in the past, and may continue to, make custom or semi-custom products on an exclusive basis for some of our customers for a negotiated period of time. The percentage of our sales related to custom or semi-custom products has been increasing over the last few years. Any revenue from sales of our custom or semi-custom products is directly related to sales of the third-party customer’s products and reflective of their success in the market. We have no control over the marketing efforts of these third-party customers and cannot make any assurances that sales of their products will be successful in current or future years. In addition, if these customers are bought by our competitors or other third parties, they may terminate agreements related to these custom or semi-custom products or otherwise limit our access to technology necessary for the production of these products. As a result, there may be no other customers for these products due to their custom or semi-custom nature. Consequently, we may not fully realize our expectations for custom or semi-custom product revenue and our operating results may be adversely affected.Additionally, failure of our customers to agree to pay for NRE costs or failure to pay enough to cover the costs we incur in connection with NREs, or non-payment of previously agreed NRE costs due to us, can harm our financial results.If we are unable to develop and introduce new and enhanced products that achieve market acceptance in a timely and cost-effective manner, our results of operations and competitive position will be harmed.Our future success will depend on our ability to develop and introduce new products and enhancements to our existing products that address customer requirements, in a timely and cost-effective manner and are competitive as to a variety of factors. For example, we must successfully identify customer requirements and design, develop and produce products on time that compete effectively as to price, functionality and performance. We sell products in markets that are characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, frequent new product introductions, and increasing demand for higher levels of integration and smaller process geometries. In addition, the development of new semiconductor solutions is highly complex and, due to a variety of factors, including supply chain cross-dependencies, dependencies on EDA and similar tools, dependencies on the use of third-party, business partner or customer intellectual property, collaboration and synchronization requirements with business partners and customers, requirements to establish new manufacturing, testing, assembly and packing processes, and other factors, we may experience delays in completing the design, development, production and introduction of our new products. Any delays could result in increased development costs, hurt our customer relationships including our ability to win new designs, resulting in lost potential future revenue, or impact our ability to allocate resources to other projects. See also, “We rely on our manufacturing partners for the manufacture, assembly, testing and packaging of our products, and the failure of any of these third-party vendors to deliver products or otherwise perform as requested or to be able to fulfill our orders could damage our relationships with our customers, decrease our sales and limit our ability to grow our business” for additional information on the impacts of supply chain cross-dependencies on our business.Our ability to adapt to changes and to anticipate future industry standards, and the rate of adoption and acceptance of those standards, will be a significant factor in maintaining or improving our competitive position and prospects for growth. We may also have to incur substantial unanticipated costs to comply with these new standards. Our success will also depend on the ability of our customers to develop new products and enhance existing products for the markets they serve and to introduce and promote those products successfully and in a timely manner. Even if we and our customers introduce new and enhanced products to the market, those products may not achieve market acceptance.23Table of ContentsSome of our customers require our products and our third-party manufacturing partners to undergo a lengthy and expensive qualification process which does not assure product sales. If we are unsuccessful or delayed in qualifying these products with a customer, our business and operating results would suffer.Prior to purchasing our products, some of our customers require that both our products and our third-party manufacturing partners undergo extensive qualification processes, which involve testing of our products in the customers’ systems, as well as testing for reliability. This qualification process can take several months and qualification of a product by a customer does not assure any sales of the product to that customer. Even after successful qualification and sales of a product to a customer, a subsequent revision in our third-party manufacturing partners’ process or our selection of a new supplier may require a new qualification process with our customers, which may result in delays and in our holding excess or obsolete inventory. After our products are qualified, it can take several months or more before the customer commences volume production of components or systems that incorporate our products. Despite these uncertainties, we devote substantial resources, including design, engineering, sales, marketing and management efforts, to qualify our products with customers in anticipation of sales. If we are unsuccessful or delayed in qualifying these products with a customer, sales of the products to the customer may be precluded or delayed, which may impede our growth and cause our business to suffer.Costs related to defective products could have a material adverse effect on us.We make highly complex semiconductor solutions and, accordingly, there is a risk of defects in our products. Such defects can give rise to the significant costs noted below. Moreover, since the cost of replacing defective products is often much higher than the value of the products themselves, we are subject to damage claims from customers in excess of the amounts they pay us for our products, including consequential damages. We also face exposure to potential liability resulting from the fact that our customers typically integrate the semiconductor solutions we sell into numerous consumer products, including automobiles. We are exposed to product liability claims if our semiconductor solutions or the consumer products integrated with our semiconductor solutions (such as automobiles), malfunction and lead to personal injury or death. In addition, our customers may issue recalls on their products if they prove to be defective or make compensatory payments in accordance with industry or business practice or in order to maintain good customer relationships. If such recalls or payments are the result of a defect in one of our products, our customers may seek to recover all or a portion of their losses from us. Recalls of our customers’ products in certain end-markets, such as with our automotive and base station customers, may cause us to incur significant costs.In addition, despite our testing procedures, we cannot ensure that errors will not be found in new products or releases after commencement of commercial shipments in the future. Such errors could result in:    •loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products;•material recall and replacement costs;•delay in revenue recognition or loss of revenue;•writing down the inventory of defective products;•the diversion of the attention of our engineering personnel from product development efforts;•our having to defend against litigation related to defective products or related property damage or personal injury; and•damage to our reputation in the industry that could adversely affect our relationships with our customers.In addition, the process of identifying a recalled product in devices that have been widely distributed may be lengthy and require significant resources. We may have difficulty identifying the end customers of the defective products in the field, which may cause us to incur significant replacement costs, contract damage claims from our customers and further reputational harm. Any of these problems could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.Despite our best efforts, security vulnerabilities may exist with respect to our products. Mitigation techniques designed to address such security vulnerabilities, including software and firmware updates or other preventative measures, may not operate as intended or effectively resolve such vulnerabilities. Software and firmware updates and/or other mitigation efforts may result in performance issues, system instability, data loss or corruption, unpredictable system behavior, or the theft of data by third parties, any of which could significantly harm our business and reputation. See also, “Cybersecurity risks could adversely affect our business and disrupt our operations.”24Table of ContentsWe rely on third-party distributors and manufacturers’ representatives and the failure of these distributors and manufacturers’ representatives to perform as expected could reduce our future sales.From time to time, we enter into relationships with distributors and manufacturers’ representatives to sell our products, and we are unable to predict the extent to which these partners will be successful in marketing and selling our products. Moreover, many of our distributors and manufacturers’ representatives also market and sell competing products, and may terminate their relationships with us at any time. Our future performance will also depend, in part, on our ability to attract additional distributors or manufacturers’ representatives that will be able to market and support our products effectively, especially in markets in which we have not previously distributed our products. If we cannot retain or attract distributors or manufacturers’ representatives, or if any of our distributors or manufacturer’s representatives are unsuccessful in marketing and selling our products or terminate their relationships with us, our sales and results of operations will be harmed.WE OPERATE GLOBALLY AND ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT RISKS IN MANY JURISDICTIONSAdverse changes in the political, regulatory and economic policies of governments in connection with trade with China and Chinese customers have reduced the demand for our products and damaged our business.Regulatory activity, such as tariffs, export controls and sanctions, economic sanctions and related laws have in the past and may continue to materially limit our ability to make sales to customers in China, which has in the past and may continue to harm our results of operations, reputation and financial condition. Moreover, to the extent the governments of China, the United States or other countries seek to promote use of domestically produced products or to reduce the dependence upon or use of products from another (sometimes referred to as “decoupling”), they may adopt or apply regulations or policies that have the effect of reducing business opportunities for us. Such actions may take the form of specific restrictions on particular customers, products, technology areas, or business combinations. For example, in the area of investments and mergers and acquisitions, the United States announced new requirements for approval by the United States government of outbound investments; and the approval by China regulatory authorities is required for business combinations of companies that conduct business in China over specific thresholds, regardless of where those businesses are based. Restrictions may also be imposed based on whether the supplier is considered unreliable or a security risk. For example, the Chinese government adopted a law that would restrict purchases from suppliers deemed to be “unreliable suppliers”. In May 2023, the Cyberspace Administration of China banned the sale of Micron Technology, Inc.’s products to certain entities in China and stated that such products pose significant security risks to China's critical information infrastructure supply chain and national security. Then in July 2023, China announced restrictions on the export of gallium and geranium, both of which are used in the manufacture of semiconductors, stating that such restrictions are intended to protect China’s national security. In addition, China has responded, seemingly in retaliation to a 10% tariff on imported goods, by announcing antitrust probes against certain U.S. technology companies. While we are not currently the subject of such an antitrust probe, there can be no assurance that such a probe will not be initiated in the future, which may result in substantial costs and may divert our attention and resources. While we do not expect these announced restrictions to materially impact us, any export restrictions reducing our ability to manufacture our products can adversely impact our revenues, profits and results of operations.25Table of ContentsConcerns that semiconductors are necessary for national security, manufacturing and critical infrastructure, as well as concerns of their potential use to restrict human rights, has led to increased U.S. export restrictions impacting sales of semiconductors and semiconductor technology to China or specific customers in China. For example, the addition of certain companies to the Entity List, which places export restrictions on certain foreign persons or entities by the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security, has dampened demand for our products. Due to the U.S. government restricting sales to certain customers in China, sales to some customers require licenses for us to export our products; however, in the past some of these licenses have been delayed or denied and there can be no assurances that requests for future licenses will be approved by the U.S. government. In addition, certain existing export licenses to China may be revoked due to changes in U.S. government policy. In February 2022, the U.S. National Science and Technology Council published an updated list of critical and emerging technologies, which includes semiconductors, as part of an ongoing effort to identify advanced technologies that are potentially significant to U.S. national security, which could result in more stringent export controls or a greater number of our products requiring a license for export to China. In addition, the U.S. Department of Commerce Bureau of Industry and Security recently released new controls on the export of advanced computing and semiconductor manufacturing items to China as well as transactions related to supercomputer end-uses in China with the aim of addressing U.S. national security and foreign policy concerns. The regulations published in October 2022 include new restrictions on U.S. persons with respect to activities that are not subject to the Export Administration Regulations (“EAR”), which differs from the agency’s historical approach of controlling items that are subject to the EAR, and the regulations published in October 2023 impose additional licensing requirements for exports to China (and certain other countries) of integrated circuits exceeding certain performance thresholds. Export restrictions reducing our sales of products to China, have in the past and may in the future adversely impact our revenues, profits and results of operations. In January 2025, the AI Diffusion Rule and the Foundry Due Diligence Rule were issued. While we do not expect these January 2025 restrictions to materially impact us, any export restrictions reducing our ability to manufacture our products can adversely impact our revenues, profits and results of operations.In addition to direct impacts on our products there may be indirect impacts to our business that we cannot easily quantify such as the fact that export restrictions may also impact some of our other customers’ products that incorporate ours as a component, or that may cause customers to develop their own products or solutions instead of purchasing from us or to acquire products or solutions from our competitors or other third-party sources. Moreover, concerns that U.S. companies may not be reliable suppliers as a result of the foregoing and other actions has caused, and may in the future cause, some of our customers in China to amass large inventories of our products well in advance of need or cause some of our customers to replace our products in favor of products from other suppliers. This can adversely affect accurately assessing our current and future demand for our products and our business.Most of our products are manufactured by third-party foundries located in Taiwan. In addition to restrictions imposed by the United States or China on exports or imports from one another, we may be adversely impacted by export restrictions, labeling requirements or other trade related issues or disputes, or political conflicts or tensions between China and Taiwan as these restrictions and requirements could impact or delay the delivery of our products to our customers in China. We typically sell products to customers in China pursuant to purchase orders rather than long term purchase commitments. Some customers in China may be able to cancel or defer purchase orders on short notice without incurring a penalty and, therefore, they may be more likely to do so while the tariffs and trade restrictions are in effect. See also, the Risk Factor entitled “We are subject to order and shipment uncertainties. If we are unable to accurately predict customer demand, we may hold excess or obsolete inventory, which would reduce our gross margin. Conversely, we may have insufficient inventory or be unable to obtain the supplies or contract manufacturing capacity to meet demand, which would result in lost revenue opportunities and potential loss of market share as well as damaged customer relationships.”26Table of ContentsChanges to U.S. or foreign tax, trade policy, tariff and import/export regulations may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Changes in U.S. or foreign international tax, social, political, regulatory and economic conditions or in laws and policies governing foreign trade, manufacturing, development and investment in the territories or countries where we currently sell our products or conduct our business have in the past and could in the future adversely affect our business. For example, while the Russian invasion of Ukraine (including related export and other business sanctions on Russia) has not had a material impact on us due to our limited sales to Russia and Ukraine, we are unable to predict the indirect impact this conflict will have on us through impacts to the supply chain, the global and domestic economies, interest rates or stock markets. The U.S. government has in the past, and may in the future, instituted or proposed changes in trade policies that included the negotiation or termination of trade agreements, the imposition of higher tariffs on imports into the U.S., economic sanctions on individuals, corporations or countries, and other government regulations affecting trade between the U.S. and other countries where we conduct our business. For example, on May 14, 2024, the Biden administration announced new tariffs on certain goods to encourage China to eliminate unfair trade practices regarding technology transfer, intellectual property, and innovation. The Biden administration directed increases in tariffs on a significant amount of imports from China across certain strategic sectors including semiconductors. As a result, the tariff rate on certain types of semiconductors increased from 25% to 50% in 2024. In addition, the Trump administration has recently announced new tariffs on imports from Canada, China and Mexico. These new tariffs are not expected to have a direct impact on the Company, however, any new tariffs and other changes in U.S. trade policy could trigger retaliatory actions by affected countries, and certain foreign governments have instituted or are considering imposing trade sanctions on certain U.S. goods.In addition, the U.S. government has in the past, and may in the future, adopted policies that discourage corporations from outsourcing manufacturing and production activities to foreign jurisdictions, including through tariffs or penalties on goods manufactured outside the U.S., which required us to change the way we conduct business. Political changes and trends such as populism, protectionism, economic nationalism and sentiment toward multinational companies and resulting changes to trade, tax or other laws and policies may be disruptive to our businesses. These changes in U.S. and foreign laws and policies have the potential to adversely impact the U.S. economy or certain sectors thereof, our industry and the global demand for our products, and as a result, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. See also, “Adverse changes in the political, regulatory and economic policies of governments in connection with trade with China and Chinese customers have reduced the demand for our products and damaged our business” and "Changes in existing taxation benefits, tax rules or tax practices may adversely affect our financial results.”We face additional risks due to the extent of our global operations since a majority of our products, and those of many of our customers, are manufactured and sold outside of the United States. The occurrence of any or a combination of the additional risks described below would significantly and negatively impact our business and results of operations.A substantial portion of our business is conducted outside of the United States and, as a result, we are subject to foreign business, political and economic risks. Most of our products are manufactured by our manufacturing partners outside of the United States. Most of our current qualified integrated circuit foundries are located in the same region within Taiwan. In addition, our primary assembly, testing and packaging subcontractors are located in the Pacific Rim region. For example, a substantial amount of our revenue is derived from products manufactured in Taiwan and as a result, disruptions to business in Taiwan, whether political, military, natural disasters or other events will adversely impact our business. In addition, many of our customers have operations located outside of the United States, primarily in Asia, which further exposes us to foreign risks. Sales shipped to customers with operations in Asia represented approximately 75% and 70% of our net revenue in fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively.We also have substantial operations outside of the United States. We anticipate that our manufacturing, assembly, testing, packaging and sales outside of the United States will continue to account for a substantial portion of our operations and revenue in future periods.Accordingly, we are subject to risks associated with international operations, including:•political, social and economic instability, military hostilities including invasions, wars, terrorism, political unrest, boycotts, curtailment of trade and other business restrictions;•volatile global economic conditions, including downturns or recessions in which some competitors may become more aggressive in their pricing practices, which would adversely impact our gross margin;•compliance with domestic and foreign export and import regulations, including any pending changes thereto, and difficulties in obtaining and complying with domestic and foreign export, import and other governmental approvals, permits and licenses;27Table of Contents•local laws and practices that favor local companies, including business practices that are prohibited by the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption laws and regulations;•difficulties in staffing, managing or closing foreign operations;•natural disasters or other events, including droughts or other water shortages, earthquakes, fires, tsunamis and floods, or power outages;•trade restrictions, higher tariffs, worsening trade relationship between the United States and China (or other countries), or changes in cross border taxation, particularly in light of the tariffs imposed by the U.S. government; •transportation delays such as the blockage of the Suez Canal affecting the flow of trade out of Asia, port closures and similar logistical issues;•difficulties in obtaining, managing or terminating foreign distributors;      •less effective protection of intellectual property than is afforded to us in the United States or other developed countries;•inadequate local infrastructure;•actual or threatened public health emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations, employees, customers and suppliers; and    •exposure to local banking, currency control and other financial-related risks.For example, we are subject to risks related to Israel’s declaration of war on Hamas, a U.S. designated Foreign Terrorist Organization and the current armed conflict in Israel and the Gaza Strip. We have employees in Israel. These employees may be impacted by: (1) disruptions to operations and business continuity, including physical damage or impaired access to company facilities, offices or technology, and disruptions in access to electricity, gasoline or water, and (2) workforce disruptions, including the mobilization of employees who are members of the Israeli military reserves to active duty, disrupted communication with employees in the conflict zone and restrictions on movement in areas subject to armed conflict. While these disruptions are not currently expected to have a material impact on us, at this time we are unable to predict the full impact this conflict will have on us and our employees in the future.As a result of having global operations, the sudden disruption of the supply chain and/or disruption of the manufacture of our customer’s products caused by events outside of our control has in the past and may in the future impact our results of operations by impairing our ability to timely and efficiently deliver our products. See also, “We rely on our manufacturing partners for the manufacture, assembly, testing and packaging of our products, and the failure of any of these third-party vendors to deliver products or otherwise perform as requested or to be able to fulfill our orders could damage our relationships with our customers, decrease our sales and limit our ability to grow our business.”Moreover, the international nature of our business subjects us to risk associated with the fluctuation of the U.S. dollar versus foreign currencies. Decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar versus currencies in jurisdictions where we have large fixed costs, or where our third-party manufacturing partners have significant costs, will increase the cost of such operations which could harm our results of operations. In addition, an appreciation of the U.S. dollar relative to the local currency could reduce sales of our products.WE ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE RAPID GROWTH OF THE COMPANY AND WITH OUR STRATEGIC TRANSACTIONSWe may not be able to scale our business quickly enough to meet our customers’ needs or in an efficient manner, which could harm our operating results.Over the last few years, we have rapidly increased in size. As a result, we have had to, and expect in the future to continue to need to, appropriately scale our business, internal systems and organization and to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures, to serve our growing customer base. Even if we are able to upgrade our systems and expand our staff, any such expansion will likely be expensive and complex, requiring management’s time and attention. We could also face inefficiencies, reduced productivity or operational failures as a result of our efforts to scale our business. Moreover, there are inherent risks associated with upgrading, improving and expanding our information technology systems. We cannot be sure that the expansion and improvements to our business operations will be fully or effectively implemented on a timely basis, if at all. Any failure of, or delay in, these efforts could negatively impact performance and financial results.28Table of ContentsRecent, current and potential future acquisitions, strategic investments, divestitures, mergers or joint ventures may subject us to significant risks, any of which could harm our business.Our long-term strategy has included in the past, and may continue to include in the future, identifying and acquiring, investing in or merging with suitable companies, or divesting certain business lines, assets or activities. In particular, over time, we may acquire, make investments in, or merge with providers of product offerings that complement our business or may terminate or dispose of business lines, assets or activities if they are no longer in alignment with our operational strategy and priorities. This strategy, and our willingness to use cash to pay for such transactions, may be adversely impacted by high or increasing interest rates. Mergers, acquisitions and divestitures include a number of risks and present financial, managerial and operational challenges. Given that our resources are limited, any decision to pursue a transaction has opportunity costs; accordingly, if we pursue a particular transaction, we may need to forgo the prospect of entering into other transactions or making other capital allocation decisions that could help us achieve our strategic objectives.Any acquired business, technology, service or product could significantly underperform relative to our expectations. Our acquisitions may not further our business strategy as we expected, we may not integrate an acquired company or technology as successfully as we expected, we may impose our business practices that adversely impact the acquired business or we may overpay for, or otherwise not realize the expected return on our investments, each or all of which could adversely affect our business or operating results and potentially cause impairment to assets that we recorded as a part of an acquisition including intangible assets and goodwill. In addition, the use of our stock to finance an acquisition, will result in an increase in the number of outstanding shares and will reduce the ownership percentage of each of our outstanding stockholders.When we decide to sell assets or a business, we may have difficulty selling on acceptable terms in a timely manner or at all. These circumstances could delay the achievement of our strategic objectives or cause us to incur additional expense, or we may sell a business or other assets at a price or on terms that are less favorable than we had anticipated, resulting in a loss on the transaction.If we do enter into agreements with respect to acquisitions, divestitures, or other transactions, these transactions, or parts of these transactions, may fail to be completed due to factors such as: failure to obtain regulatory or other approvals; disputes or litigation; or difficulties obtaining financing for the transaction. In addition, such transactions are increasingly being subjected to regulatory review and other burdens, which could delay the closing of any transaction and greatly increase the costs related to such transaction. For example, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission recently announced new HSR rules that are expected to greatly expand disclosure requirements and require significantly more time to prepare filings.If we fail to complete a transaction, we may nonetheless have incurred significant expenses in connection with such transaction. Failure to complete a pending transaction may result in negative publicity and a negative perception of us among the investment community. In addition, we used a significant portion of our cash and incurred substantial indebtedness in connection with the financing of our acquisition of Inphi, which was completed in fiscal 2022. Our use of cash to fund our acquisitions has reduced our liquidity and may (i) limit our flexibility in responding to other business opportunities and (ii) increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions. Furthermore, the financing agreements in connection with our outstanding indebtedness contain negative covenants, limitations on indebtedness, liens, sale and leaseback transactions and mergers and other fundamental changes. Our ability to comply with these negative covenants can be affected by events beyond our control. See also, “We are subject to risks related to our debt obligations.”For all these reasons, our pursuit of an acquisition, investment, divestiture, merger or joint venture could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated.29Table of ContentsWE ARE SUBJECT TO CYBERSECURITY RISKSCybersecurity risks could adversely affect our business and disrupt our operations.We depend heavily on our technology infrastructure and maintain and rely upon certain critical information systems for the effective operation of our business. We routinely collect and store sensitive data in our information systems, including intellectual property and other proprietary information about our business and that of our customers, suppliers and manufacturing and other business partners. These information technology systems are subject to damage or interruption from several potential sources, including, but not limited to, natural disasters, destructive or inadequate code, malware, power failures, cyber-attacks, nation state advanced persistent threats, vendor errors causing operational interruptions, insider threats or other events. Cyber-attacks may include phishing or other forms of social engineering attacks, exploits of code or system configurations, malicious code, such as viruses and worms, ransomware attacks, zero day vulnerabilities and undisclosed security flaws exploited by threat actors, nation-state cyber warfare attacks, supply chain and third-party cyber-attacks, denial-of-service attacks and other actions granting unauthorized access to our technology infrastructure or information systems or those of our customers, suppliers and manufacturing and other business partners. In addition, we have in the past and may in the future be the target of email phishing attacks that attempt to acquire personal information or Company assets. As AI capabilities improve and become increasingly commonplace, we may see cyberattacks leveraging AI technology. These attacks could be crafted with an AI tool to directly attack information systems with increased speed and/or efficiency compared to a human threat actor or create more effective phishing emails. In addition, a vulnerability could be introduced from the result of our or our customers and business partners incorporating the output of an AI tool, such as AI generated source code, that includes a threat.We have implemented cybersecurity processes, as discussed in more detail below, taking guidance from recognized cybersecurity frameworks to mitigate risks; however, we cannot guarantee that those risk mitigation measures will be effective. See Item 1C, “Cybersecurity” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information about our cybersecurity processes. We have not experienced a material information security breach in the last three years, and as a result, we have not incurred any net expenses from such a breach. We have not been penalized or paid any amount under an information security breach settlement over the last three years. Further, we annually assess our insurance policy and have determined not to purchase cyber related insurance. Cyber-attacks have become increasingly more prevalent and much harder to detect, defend against or prevent. The risk of state-sponsored or geopolitical-related cybersecurity incidents has also increased recently due to geopolitical tensions or incidents, such as the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the armed conflict in Israel and the Gaza Strip. While we have historically been successful in defending against the cyber-attacks and breaches mentioned above, given the frequency of cyber-attacks and resulting breaches reported by other businesses and governments, it is likely we will experience one or more material breaches of some extent in the future. We have incurred and may in the future incur significant costs to implement, maintain and/or update security systems we believe are necessary to protect our information systems, or we may miscalculate the level of investment necessary to protect our systems adequately. Since the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and are often not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures.Our business also requires us to work with and in some cases to share confidential information with manufacturing partners, suppliers, customers and other third parties. Although we take steps to secure our confidential information that is provided to third parties, such measures may not always be effective. Data breaches, losses or other unauthorized access to or releases of confidential information have in the past occurred with these third parties and material data breaches, losses or other unauthorized access to, or releases of, our confidential information may in the future occur in connection with third-party breaches that could materially adversely affect our reputation, financial condition and operating results and could result in liability or penalties under data privacy laws. In addition, we may be subject to losses of access to all or part our systems because of our use of third-party services or software, which losses may not always be the result of malicious activity, and we cannot guarantee that any such future outages will not materially impact the Company.To the extent that any system failure, accident or security breach results in material disruptions or interruptions to our operations, or those of our customers, suppliers and manufacturing and other business partners, or the theft, loss or disclosure of, or damage to our data or confidential information, including our intellectual property, our reputation, business, results of operations and/or financial condition could be materially adversely affected.30Table of ContentsWE ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS RELATED TO OUR DEBT OBLIGATIONSOur indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations and limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry.As of February 1, 2025, we had a total of $4.1 billion debt outstanding, which consisted of $3.5 billion of senior notes outstanding and $590.6 million outstanding under our 2026 Term Loan. We also had $1.0 billion of availability under our 2023 Revolving Credit Facility.Our indebtedness could have important consequences to us including:•increasing our vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry conditions;•requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, research and development efforts, execution of our business strategy, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;•limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the economy and the semiconductor industry;•placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with less indebtedness;•exposing us to interest rate risk to the extent of our variable rate indebtedness, particularly in the current environment of high or rising interest rates; and•making it more difficult to borrow additional funds in the future to fund growth, acquisitions, working capital, capital expenditures and other purposes.Although the Credit Agreements contain restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness and the indentures governing the Notes (together, the “Notes Indentures”) contain restrictions on creating liens and entering into certain sale-leaseback transactions, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and the additional indebtedness, liens or sale-leaseback transactions incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial.The Credit Agreements, the Notes Indentures and the indenture governing the MTI Senior Notes contain customary events of default upon the occurrence of which, after any applicable grace period, the lenders would have the ability to immediately declare the loans due and payable in whole or in part. In such event, we may not have sufficient available cash to repay such debt at the time it becomes due, or be able to refinance such debt on acceptable terms or at all. Any of the foregoing could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.The Credit Agreements and the Notes Indentures impose restrictions on our business.The Credit Agreements and the Notes Indentures each contains a number of covenants imposing restrictions on our business. These restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. The restrictions, among other things, restrict our ability and our subsidiaries’ ability to create or incur certain liens, incur or guarantee additional indebtedness, merge or consolidate with other companies, pay dividends, transfer or sell assets and make restricted payments. These restrictions are subject to a number of limitations and exceptions set forth in the Credit Agreements and the Notes Indentures. Our ability to meet the leverage ratio set forth in the Credit Agreements may be affected by events beyond our control.The foregoing restrictions could limit our ability to plan for, or react to, changes in market conditions or our capital needs. We do not know whether we will be granted waivers under, or amendments to, our Credit Agreements or to the Notes Indentures if for any reason we are unable to meet these requirements, or whether we will be able to refinance our indebtedness on terms acceptable to us, or at all.31Table of ContentsWe may be unable to generate the cash flow to service our debt obligations.We may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to enable us to service our indebtedness, including the Notes, or to make anticipated capital expenditures. Our ability to pay our expenses and satisfy our debt obligations, refinance our debt obligations and fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or to borrow sufficient funds in the future to service our debt, we may be required to sell assets, reduce capital expenditures, refinance all or a portion of our existing debt (including the Notes) or obtain additional financing. In addition, if our credit ratings are downgraded, the cost of current or future borrowings under our Credit Agreements may rise and our ability to obtain additional financing or refinance our existing debt may be negatively affected. We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance our debt, sell assets or borrow more money on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt, we will be in default and holders of our debt could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. In addition, a material default on our indebtedness could suspend our eligibility to register securities using certain registration statement forms under SEC guidelines that permit incorporation by reference of substantial information regarding us, potentially hindering our ability to raise capital through the issuance of our securities and increasing our costs of registration.We may, under certain circumstances, be required to repurchase the Notes at the option of the holder.We will be required to repurchase the Notes at the option of each holder upon the occurrence of a change of control repurchase event as defined in the Notes Indentures. However, we may not have sufficient funds to repurchase the Notes in cash at the time of any change of control repurchase event. Our failure to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control repurchase event would be an event of default under the Notes Indentures and could cause a cross-default or acceleration under the Credit Agreements and certain future agreements governing our other indebtedness. The repayment obligations under the Notes may have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a takeover of our company. If we were required to repurchase the Notes prior to their scheduled maturity, it could have a significant negative impact on our cash and liquidity and could impact our ability to invest financial resources in other strategic initiatives.CHANGES IN OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE MAY REDUCE OUR NET INCOMEChanges in existing taxation benefits, tax rules or tax practices may adversely affect our financial results.As a United States domiciled company, the income from all of our foreign subsidiaries is subject to the U.S. tax provisions applicable to Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (“GILTI”), which generally requires that GILTI income be included in the taxable income of U.S. entities. The U.S. currently has a federal corporate tax rate of 21%. President Biden signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “IRA”) on August 16, 2022 and the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 on August 9, 2022. These laws implement new tax provisions and provide for various incentives and tax credits. The IRA applies to tax years beginning after December 31, 2022 and introduces a 15% alternative minimum tax for corporations whose average annual adjusted financial statement income for any consecutive three-tax-year period preceding the tax year exceeds $1 billion and a 1% excise tax on certain stock repurchases made by publicly traded U.S. corporations after December 31, 2022. While we are not currently subject to additional taxes under the IRA, if in the future, we become subject to these taxes, it could significantly affect our financial results, including our earnings and cash flows.The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (the “OECD”) has been working on a Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project, and since 2015 has been issuing guidelines and proposals with respect to various aspects of the existing framework under which our tax obligations are determined in countries in which we do business. Many countries have implemented legislation and other guidance to align their international rules with the OECD’s legal framework, including enacting a minimum tax rate of at least 15% as part of the OECD’s “Pillar Two” initiative. During December 2022, the European Union reached agreement on the introduction of a minimum tax directive requiring member states to enact local legislation. On October 15, 2024, Singapore enacted legislation implementing aspects of Pillar Two, including a 15% minimum top up tax for periods beginning on or after January 1, 2025. We expect this legislation to result in an increase to our effective tax rate, and the impact could be significant to our financial results, earnings, and cash flows. On July 29, 2024, the Israeli Ministry of Finance announced that it intends to implement Qualified Domestic Minimum Top-up Tax (“QDMTT”) in Israel, which will be effective for our fiscal year 2027. No legislation in Israel has been enacted at this time regarding Pillar Two. We will continue to monitor countries’ laws with respect to the OECD model rules and the Pillar Two global minimum tax. The effects of any future legislation in this area are not yet reasonably estimable, but if such legislation is enacted in the future, could have a significant effect on our provision for income taxes, our financial results, and our earnings and cash flows.32Table of ContentsWe calculate our income taxes based on currently enacted laws. Because of increasing focus by government taxing authorities on multinational companies, the tax laws of certain countries in which we do business could change on a prospective or retroactive basis, and any such changes could increase our liabilities for taxes, interest and penalties, and could significantly adversely affect our financial results, including our earnings and cash flows.In prior years, we entered into incentive agreements in certain foreign jurisdictions that provide for reduced income tax rates in such jurisdictions if certain criteria are met. The tax benefits associated with these reduced income tax rates are recorded through our income tax provision for the periods in which such incentive tax rates are effective. Receipt of past and future benefits under tax agreements and incentives may depend on several factors, including but not limited to, our ability to fulfill commitments regarding employment of personnel, investment, or performance of specified activities in the applicable jurisdictions as well as changes in foreign laws, including changes related to minimum tax rates under Pillar Two, which could significantly reduce the future income tax benefits associated with our incentives. In addition, changes in our business plans, including divestitures, as well as changes to tax laws, including changes related to Pillar Two, could result in termination of or renegotiation of an agreement or loss of tax benefits thereunder. If any of our tax agreements in any of these foreign jurisdictions were terminated or renegotiated, our results of operations and our financial position could be harmed.In prior periods, we transferred certain intellectual property to a related entity in Singapore. The impact to us was based on our determination of the fair value of this property, which required management to make significant estimates and to apply complex tax regulations in multiple jurisdictions. In future periods, local tax authorities may challenge our valuations of these assets, which could reduce our expected tax benefits from these transactions.Our profitability and effective tax rate could be impacted by unexpected changes to our statutory income tax rates or income tax liabilities. Such changes could result from various items, including changes in tax laws or regulations, changes to court or administrative interpretations of tax laws, changes to our geographic mix of earnings, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in valuation allowances on our deferred tax assets, discrete items, changes in our supply chain, and changes due to audit assessments. In particular, the tax benefits associated with our transfer of intellectual property to Singapore are sensitive to our future profitability and taxable income in Singapore, audit assessments, and changes in applicable tax law. Our current corporate effective tax rate fluctuates significantly from period to period, and is based on the application of currently applicable income tax laws, regulations and treaties, as well as current judicial and administrative interpretations of these income tax laws, regulations and treaties, in various jurisdictions.WE ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS RELATED TO OUR ASSETSWe are exposed to potential impairment charges on certain assets.We had approximately $11.6 billion of goodwill and $2.7 billion of acquired intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheet as of February 1, 2025. Under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, we are required to review our intangible assets including goodwill for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. We perform an assessment of goodwill for impairment annually on the last business day of our fiscal fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable. When testing goodwill for impairment, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value or we may determine to proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test.Factors we consider important in the qualitative assessment which could trigger a goodwill impairment review include: significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results; significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business; significant negative industry or economic trends; a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period; and a significant change in our market capitalization relative to our net book value.We assess the impairment of intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. Circumstances which could trigger a review include, but are not limited to the following: significant decreases in the market price of the asset; significant adverse changes in the business climate or legal factors; accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of the asset; current period cash flow or operating losses combined with a history of losses or a forecast of continuing losses associated with the use of the asset; and current expectation that the asset will more likely than not be sold or disposed of significantly before the end of its estimated useful life. For example, if the operations of any businesses that we have acquired declines significantly, we could incur significant intangible asset impairment charges.33Table of ContentsFor example, a restructuring plan was initiated during the third quarter of fiscal 2025 to increase research and development investment in the data center end market and reduce the investment in new product development in other end markets including the cancellation of certain future product releases. As a result, we were required to assess the recoverability of related long-lived assets. On completion of the assessment, the Company determined the carrying values of certain long-lived assets were not recoverable. We utilized a discounted cash flow method of valuation to determine the fair value of the associated assets and liabilities compared to their carrying values, which resulted in recognition of asset impairment charges for acquired intangible assets, purchased technology licenses, and property and equipment. We recognized $711.8 million of restructuring related charges during fiscal 2025. See “Note 4 – Restructuring” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. We have determined that our business operates as a single operating segment and has a single reporting unit for the purpose of goodwill impairment testing. The fair value of the reporting unit is determined by taking our market capitalization as determined through quoted market prices and as adjusted for a control premium and other relevant factors. If our fair value declines to below our carrying value, we could incur significant goodwill impairment charges, which could negatively impact our financial results. If in the future a change in our organizational structure results in more than one reporting unit, we will be required to allocate our goodwill and perform an assessment of goodwill for impairment in each reporting unit. As a result, we could have an impairment of goodwill in one or more of such future reporting units.In addition, from time to time, we have made investments in private companies. If the companies that we invest in are unable to execute their plans and succeed in their respective markets, we may not benefit from such investments, and we could potentially lose the amounts we invest. We evaluate our investment portfolio on a regular basis to determine if impairments have occurred. Impairment charges could have a significant effect on our results of operations in any period.We are subject to the risks of owning real property.Our buildings in Santa Clara, California and Shanghai, China subject us to the risks of owning real property, which include, but are not limited to:•the possibility of environmental contamination and the costs associated with remediating any environmental problems;      •adverse changes in the value of these properties due to economic conditions, the movement by many companies to a full time work from home or a hybrid work environment, interest rate changes, changes in the neighborhood in which the property is located, or other factors;      •the possible need for structural improvements in order to comply with zoning, seismic and other legal or regulatory requirements;      •the potential disruption of our business and operations arising from or connected with a relocation due to moving or to renovating the facility;      •increased cash commitments for improvements to the buildings or the property, or both;•increased operating expenses for the buildings or the property, or both;•possible disputes with third parties related to the buildings or the property, or both;•failure to achieve expected cost savings due to extended non-occupancy of a vacated property intended to be leased; and•the risk of financial loss in excess of amounts covered by insurance, or uninsured risks, such as the loss caused by damage to the buildings as a result of earthquakes, floods and/or other natural disasters.WE ARE SUBJECT TO IP RISKS AND RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGSWe may be unable to protect our intellectual property, which would negatively affect our ability to compete.We believe one of our key competitive advantages results from the collection of proprietary technologies we have developed and acquired since our inception, and the protection of our intellectual property rights is, and will continue to be, important to the success of our business. If we fail to protect these intellectual property rights, competitors could sell products based on technology that we have developed, which could harm our competitive position and decrease our revenue.34Table of ContentsWe rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, contractual provisions, confidentiality agreements, licenses and other methods, to protect our proprietary technologies. We also enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees, consultants, manufacturing or other business partners, and control access to and distribution of our documentation and other proprietary information. Notwithstanding these agreements, we have experienced disputes with employees regarding ownership of intellectual property in the past. To the extent that any third-party has a claim to ownership of any relevant technologies used in our products, we may not be able to recognize the full revenue stream from such relevant technologies. See also, “We have been named as a party to several legal proceedings and may be named in additional ones in the future, including litigation involving our patents and other intellectual property, which could subject us to liability, require us to indemnify our customers, require us to obtain or renew licenses, require us to stop selling our products or force us to redesign our products.”We have been issued a significant number of U.S. and foreign patents and have a significant number of pending U.S. and foreign patent applications. However, a patent may not be issued as a result of any applications or, if issued, claims allowed may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. In addition, it is possible that existing or future patents may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. We may also be required to license some of our patents to others including competitors as a result of our participation in and contribution to development of industry standards. Despite our efforts, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or proprietary technology. Monitoring unauthorized use of our technology is difficult, and the steps that we have taken may not prevent unauthorized use of our technology, particularly in jurisdictions where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the United States or other developed countries. If our patents do not adequately protect our technology, our competitors may be able to offer products similar to ours, which would adversely impact our business and results of operations. In addition, we have implemented security systems with the intent of maintaining the physical security of our facilities and protecting our confidential information including our intellectual property. Despite our efforts, we may be subject to breach of these security systems and controls which may result in unauthorized access to our facilities and labs and/or unauthorized use or theft of the confidential information and intellectual property we are trying to protect. See also, “Cybersecurity risks could adversely affect our business and disrupt our operations.” If we fail to protect these intellectual property rights, competitors could sell products based on technology that we have developed, which could harm our competitive position and decrease our revenue.Certain of our software, as well as that of our customers, may be derived from so-called “open source” software that is generally made available to the public by its authors and/or other third parties. Open source software is made available under licenses that impose certain obligations on us in the event we were to distribute derivative works of the open source software. These obligations may require us to make source code for the derivative works available to the public and/or license such derivative works under a particular type of license, rather than the forms of license we customarily use to protect our intellectual property. While we believe we have complied with our obligations under the various applicable licenses for open source software, in the event that the copyright holder of any open source software were to successfully establish in court that we had not complied with the terms of a license for a particular work, we could be required to release the source code of that work to the public and/or stop distribution of that work if the license is terminated which could adversely impact our business and results of operations.Further, governments and courts are considering new issues in intellectual property law with respect to works created by AI technology, which could result in different intellectual property rights in development processes, procedures and technologies we create with AI technology, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.35Table of ContentsWe must comply with a variety of existing and future laws and regulations, as well as sustainability initiatives, that could impose substantial costs on us and may adversely affect our business.We are subject to laws and regulations worldwide, which may differ among jurisdictions, affecting our operations in areas including, but not limited to: intellectual property ownership and infringement; tax; import and export requirements; anti-corruption; anti-trust; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; conflict minerals; data privacy requirements; competition; advertising; employment and human rights; product regulations; environment, health and safety requirements; securities registration laws; and consumer laws. For example, government export regulations apply to the encryption or other features contained in some of our products. If we fail to continue to receive licenses or otherwise comply with these regulations, we may be unable to manufacture the affected products at foreign foundries or ship these products to certain customers, or we may incur penalties or fines. In addition, we are subject to various industry requirements restricting the presence of certain substances in electronic products. Although our management systems are designed to maintain compliance, we cannot assure you that we have been or will be at all times in compliance with such laws and regulations. Our compliance programs rely in part on compliance by our manufacturing partners, suppliers, vendors and distributors. To the extent such third parties do not comply with these obligations our business, operations and reputation may be adversely impacted. If we violate or fail to comply with any of the above requirements, a range of consequences could result, including fines, import/export restrictions, sales limitations, criminal and civil liabilities or other sanctions. The costs of complying with these laws (including the costs of any investigations, auditing and monitoring) could adversely affect our current or future business.Our product or manufacturing standards could also be impacted by new or revised environmental rules and regulations or other social initiatives. For example, a significant portion of our revenues come from international sales. Environmental legislation, such as the EU Directive on Restriction of Hazardous Substances (“RoHS”), the EU Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (“WEEE Directive”) and China’s regulation on Management Methods for Controlling Pollution Caused by Electronic Information Products, may increase our cost of doing business internationally and impact our revenues from the EU, China and other countries with similar environmental legislation as we endeavor to comply with and implement these requirements.Increasingly regulators (including the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission), customers, investors, employees and other stakeholders are focusing on sustainability matters. We are, and expect to continue to be, subject to various proposed, new, and evolving sustainability laws and requirements including both voluntary and mandatory disclosure requirements that may impact how we and our business partners, suppliers and customers conduct business. While we have certain sustainability initiatives at the Company there can be no assurance that regulators, customers, investors, and employees will determine that these programs are sufficiently robust. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to accomplish our announced goals related to our sustainability program, as statements regarding our sustainability goals reflect our current plans and aspirations and are not guarantees that we will be able to achieve them within the timelines we announce or at all. Actual or perceived shortcomings with respect to our sustainability initiatives and reporting can impact our ability to hire and retain employees, increase our customer base, reelect our Board of Directors, or attract and retain certain types of investors. In addition, these parties are increasingly focused on specific disclosures and frameworks related to sustainability matters. Collecting, measuring, and reporting sustainability information and metrics can be costly, difficult and time consuming, is subject to evolving reporting standards, and can present numerous operational, reputational, financial, legal and other risks, any of which could have a material impact on us, including on our reputation and stock price. Inadequate processes to collect and review this information prior to disclosure could subject us to potential liability related to such information. In addition, several U.S. states and President Trump have enacted or proposed “anti-ESG” policies or legislation. If our sustainability practices are deemed to be in contradiction of such “anti-ESG” policies we could be subjected to government investigations or lawsuits that could negatively impact the Company and affect the price of our common stock. In addition, social activists have recently been successful in pressuring certain public companies to eliminate or cut back on their diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives and their sustainability initiatives. To the extent we are subject to such activism, it may require us to incur costs or may otherwise adversely impact our business.A portion of the business we acquired in fiscal 2021 requires facility security clearances under the National Industrial Security Program. The National Industrial Security Program requires that a corporation maintaining a facility security clearance be effectively insulated from foreign ownership, control or influence (“FOCI”). Because we were organized in Bermuda at the time of this acquisition, we entered into agreements with the U.S. Department of Defense with respect to FOCI mitigation arrangements that relate to our operation of the portion of the business involving facility clearances. After our domestication, we requested and have now received partial release from some of these obligations. The remaining measures and arrangements may materially and adversely affect our operating results due to the increased cost of compliance with these measures. If we fail to comply with our obligations under these agreements, our ability to operate our business may be adversely affected.36Table of ContentsWe are a party to certain contracts with the U.S. government, federal prime contractors, and federal subcontractors. Our contracts with the U.S. government or its subcontractors are subject to various procurement regulations and other requirements relating to their formation, administration and performance. These regulations and requirements include supply chain restrictions that may prohibit the sourcing of materials, supplies, or services from foreign entities including those located in or organized in China. We may be subject to audits and investigations relating to our government contracts, and any violations could result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, refunding or suspending of payments, forfeiture of profits, payment of fines, and suspension or debarment from future government business. In addition, such contracts may provide for termination by the government at any time, without cause. Any of these risks related to contracting with the U.S. government, federal prime contractors, and federal subcontractors could adversely impact our future sales and operating results.New technology trends, such as AI, require us to keep pace with evolving regulations and industry standards. In the United States (including in individual states), the European Union, and China, there are various current and proposed regulatory frameworks relating to the use of AI in products and services. We expect that the legal and regulatory environment relating to emerging technologies such as AI will continue to develop and could increase the cost of doing business, and create compliance risks and potential liability, all which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.We have been named as a party to several legal proceedings and may be named in additional ones in the future, including litigation involving our patents and other intellectual property, which could subject us to liability, require us to indemnify our customers, require us to obtain or renew licenses, require us to stop selling our products or force us to redesign our products.We are currently, and have been in the past, named as a party to several lawsuits, government inquiries or investigations and other legal proceedings (collectively referred to as “litigation”), and we may be named in additional litigation in the future. Please see “Note 8 – Commitments and Contingencies” of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a more detailed description of any material litigation matters in which we may be currently engaged.In particular, litigation involving patents and other intellectual property is widespread in the high-technology industry and is particularly prevalent in the semiconductor industry, where a number of companies and other entities aggressively bring numerous infringement claims to assert their patent portfolios. The amount of damages alleged in intellectual property infringement claims can often be very significant. See also, “We may be unable to protect our intellectual property, which would negatively affect our ability to compete.”From time to time, we receive and our customers receive, and we and our customers may continue to receive in the future, standards-based or other types of infringement claims, as well as claims against us and our proprietary technologies. These claims could result in litigation and/or claims for indemnification, which, in turn, could subject us to significant liability for damages, attorneys’ fees and costs. Any potential intellectual property litigation also could force us to do one or more of the following:•stop selling, offering for sale, making, having made or exporting products or using technology that contains the allegedly infringing intellectual property;      •limit or restrict the type of work that employees involved in such litigation may perform for us;•pay substantial damages and/or license fees and/or royalties to the party claiming infringement or other license violations that could adversely impact our liquidity or operating results;      •attempt to obtain or renew licenses to the relevant intellectual property, which licenses may not be available on reasonable terms or at all; and      •attempt to redesign those products that contain the allegedly infringing intellectual property.Under certain circumstances, we have contractual and other legal obligations to indemnify and to incur legal expenses for current and former directors and officers. See also, “Our indemnification obligations and limitations of our director and officer liability insurance may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.” Additionally, from time to time, we have agreed to indemnify select customers for claims alleging infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, including, but not limited to, patents, registered trademarks and/or copyrights. If we are required to make a significant payment under any of our indemnification obligations, our results of operations may be harmed.37Table of ContentsThe ultimate outcome of litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business and the trading price for our securities. Litigation may be time consuming, expensive, and disruptive to normal business operations, and the outcome of litigation is difficult to predict. Litigation, regardless of the outcome, may result in significant expenditures, diversion of our management’s time and attention from the operation of our business and damage to our reputation or relationships with third parties, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and stock price.GENERAL RISK FACTORSWe depend on highly skilled personnel to support our business operations. If we are unable to retain and motivate our current personnel or attract additional qualified personnel, our ability to develop and successfully market our products could be harmed.We believe our future success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled engineering, managerial, sales and marketing personnel. We typically do not enter into employment agreements with any of our key personnel and the loss of such personnel could harm our business, as their knowledge of our business and industry would be extremely difficult to replace. The competition for qualified personnel with significant experience in the management, design, development, manufacturing, marketing and sales of semiconductor solutions has been intense over the last few years, both in the Silicon Valley and in global markets in which we operate. Our inability to attract and retain qualified personnel, including executive officers, hardware and software engineers and sales and marketing personnel, could delay the development and introduction of, impact our ability to fulfill commitments to customers for, and harm our ability to sell, our products. In addition, if we are unable to fulfill our customer commitments in a timely manner, we may also lose future business relationships or otherwise experience negative consequences. Despite recent layoffs in the technology sector, competitors for talent increasingly seek to hire our employees and executive officers (for example, our former Chief Financial Officer was hired by another semiconductor company in fiscal 2023), and the increased availability of work-from-home arrangements has both intensified and expanded competition. As a result, during the last few years, we have increased our efforts to recruit and retain talent. These efforts have increased our expenses, resulted in a higher volume of equity issuances, and may not be successful in attracting, retaining, and motivating the workforce necessary to deliver on our strategy. We believe equity compensation is a valuable component of our compensation program which helps us to attract, retain, and motivate employees and as a result we issue stock-based awards, such as restricted stock unit awards, to a significant portion of our employees. A significant change in our stock price or lower stock price performance relative to competitors, may reduce the retention value of our stock-based awards. Our employee hiring and retention also depends on our ability to build and maintain a diverse and inclusive workplace culture and be viewed as an employer of choice. To the extent our compensation programs and workplace culture are not viewed as competitive, our ability to attract, retain, and motivate employees may be weakened, which could harm our results of operations.Changes to U.S. immigration and export policies that restrict our ability to attract and retain technical personnel may negatively affect our research and development efforts. In addition, changes in employment-related laws applicable to our workforce practices may also result in increased expenses and less flexibility in how we meet our changing workforce needs. In addition, as a result of our past and any future acquisitions and related integration activities, our current and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their futures that may impair our ability to retain, recruit or motivate key management, engineering, technical and other personnel.We previously adopted a hybrid work policy for our employees, but more recently adopted a policy requiring employees to return to working full time in the office as of June 2, 2025. Many companies, including companies that we compete with for talent, have adopted plans to adopt full time remote work arrangements or hybrid work arrangements more flexible than ours, which may impact our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel if potential or current employees prefer these policies. In addition, as a result of our current hybrid and future full time in the office work environments, we expect to face challenges in retention of personnel who prefer work from home policies. 38Table of ContentsThere can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends or effect stock repurchases in any particular amount or at all, and statutory requirements may require us to defer payment of declared dividends or suspend stock repurchases.In the first quarter of fiscal 2025, our Board of Directors increased our stock repurchase program to add an additional $3.0 billion to that program. Future payment of a regular quarterly cash dividend on our common stock and future stock repurchases are subject to, among other things: the best interests of the Company and our stockholders; our results of operations, cash balances and future cash requirements; financial condition; developments in ongoing litigation; statutory requirements under Delaware law; securities laws and regulations, market conditions; and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. Our dividend payments or stock repurchases may change from time to time, and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare dividends or repurchase stock in any particular amounts or at all. A reduction in, a delay of, or elimination of our dividend payments or stock repurchases could have a negative effect on our stock price. As of February 1, 2025, there was $2.6 billion remaining available for future stock repurchases under the prior authorization. See “Note 10 – Stockholders’ Equity” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.Our indemnification obligations and limitations of our director and officer liability insurance may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Under Delaware law, our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws and certain indemnification agreements to which we are a party, we have an obligation to indemnify, or we have otherwise agreed to indemnify, certain of our current and former directors and officers with respect to past, current and future investigations and litigation. Further, in the event such directors and officers are ultimately determined not to be entitled to indemnification, we may not be able to recover any amounts we previously advanced to them.We cannot provide any assurances that any future indemnification claims, including the cost of fees, penalties or other expenses, will not exceed the limits of our insurance policies, that such claims are covered by the terms of our insurance policies or that our insurance carrier will be able to cover our claims. Additionally, to the extent there is coverage of these claims, the insurers also may seek to deny or limit coverage in some or all of these matters. Furthermore, our insurers could become insolvent and unable to fulfill their obligation to defend, pay or reimburse us for insured claims. Due to these coverage limitations, we may incur significant unreimbursed costs to satisfy our indemnification obligations, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.As we carry only limited insurance coverage, any incurred liability resulting from uncovered claims could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.Our insurance policies may not be adequate to fully offset losses from covered incidents, and we do not have coverage for certain losses. For example, there is very limited coverage available with respect to the services provided by our third-party manufacturing partners and assembly, testing and packaging subcontractors. In the event of a natural disaster (such as drought, earthquake or tsunami), political or military turmoil, widespread public health emergencies including pandemics, power outages, cyber-attacks or incidents, or other significant disruptions to their operations, insurance may not adequately protect us from this exposure. We believe our existing insurance coverage is consistent with common practice, economic considerations and availability considerations. If our insurance coverage is insufficient to protect us against unforeseen losses, any uncovered losses could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.We face risks related to global pandemics, which may significantly disrupt and adversely impact our manufacturing, research and development, operations, sales and financial results.Our business was adversely impacted by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and may be similarly adversely impacted by future pandemics. In addition to global and domestic macroeconomic effects, during fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2023 the COVID-19 pandemic and related adverse public health measures caused disruption to our global operations and sales. Our third-party manufacturing partners, suppliers, distributors, and customers were disrupted by worker absenteeism, quarantines and restrictions on their employees’ ability to work; office and factory closures; disruptions to ports and other shipping infrastructure; border closures; and other travel or health-related restrictions. Although the pandemic related restrictions above have ceased in most places, resurgences of COVID-19 in various regions and appearances of new variants of the virus, has resulted in the past, and may result in the future, in their full or partial reinstitution. In addition, although many countries have vaccinated large segments of their population, during fiscal 2023, the COVID-19 pandemic continued to disrupt business activities, trade, and supply chains in many countries. 39Table of ContentsAdverse developments affecting the financial services industry, including events or risks involving liquidity, defaults or non-performance by financial institutions, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.On March 10, 2023, Silicon Valley Bank (“SVB”), where we maintained certain accounts with an immaterial amount of cash deposits, was placed into receivership with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”), which resulted in all funds held at SVB being temporarily inaccessible by SVB’s customers. As of March 13, 2023, access to our accounts at SVB was fully restored. We do not expect further developments with SVB (or similar regional banks) to have a material impact on our cash and cash equivalents, however, we do hold cash balances in several large financial institutions significantly in excess of FDIC and global insurance limits. If other banks and financial institutions with whom we have banking relationships enter receivership or become insolvent in the future, we may be unable to access, and we may lose, some or all of our existing cash, cash equivalents and investments to the extent those funds are not insured or otherwise protected by the FDIC.If any of our non-U.S. based subsidiaries were classified as a passive foreign investment company, there would be adverse tax consequences.If any of our non-U.S. based subsidiaries were classified as a “passive foreign investment company” or “PFIC” under section 1297 of the Internal Revenue Code, of 1986, as amended, for any taxable year during which a U.S. holder holds common stock, such U.S. holder generally would be taxed at ordinary income tax rates on any gain realized on the sale or exchange of the stock and on any “excess distributions” (including constructive distributions) received on the shares. Such U.S. holder could also be subject to a special interest charge with respect to any such gain or excess distribution.A non-U.S. entity would be classified as a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes in any taxable year in which either (i) at least 75% of its gross income is passive income or (ii) on average, the percentage of its assets that produce passive income or are held for the production of passive income is at least 50% (determined on an average gross value basis). Whether an entity will, in fact, be classified as a PFIC for any taxable year depends on its assets and income over the course of the relevant taxable year and, as a result, cannot be predicted with certainty. There can be no assurance that any of our foreign based subsidiaries will not be classified as a PFIC in the future or the Internal Revenue Service will not challenge our determination concerning PFIC status for any prior period.Item 1B. Unresolved Staff CommentsNone.Item 1C. Cybersecurity Cybersecurity Risk Management and StrategyWe recognize the importance of assessing, identifying, and managing risks associated with cybersecurity threats, as such term is defined in Item 106(a) of Regulation S-K, and have implemented processes for our systems taking guidance from recognized cybersecurity frameworks, such as U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (“NIST”) Cyber Security Framework (“CSF”) in an effort to mitigate risks. As part of these proactive measures, we maintain a Cybersecurity Incident Response and Escalation Process with defined roles, responsibilities, and reporting protocols that is periodically reviewed, tested, and updated. The Company has an Executive Cyber Response and Disclosure Committee (consisting of senior executives from the business, finance, operations and legal functions), which is responsible for determining what actions are necessary to respond to cybersecurity events, with input from the Chief Security Officer (“CSO”) and other subject matter experts directly participating in incident response efforts. Furthermore, we conduct an annual full board briefing on cybersecurity, ensuring that our Board of Directors is regularly informed of the evolving landscape of cybersecurity risks and mitigation strategies.Identifying and assessing cybersecurity risk is integrated into our overall risk management systems and processes. Additionally, on a quarterly basis, our Audit Committee receives reports from the Chief Information Officer, CSO, and other members of management. As part of its annual assessment, the Audit Committee evaluates significant risks related to our business including cybersecurity risks, and provides such information to our Board of Directors. Our Internal Audit team also reviews our cybersecurity governance and controls annually. 40Table of ContentsOur cybersecurity risk management program encompasses periodic risk assessments, designed to help identify cybersecurity risks to our critical systems, information, services, and our broader enterprise IT environment. More specifically, an independent third-party performs a regular penetration test of our IT infrastructure. In addition to our penetration testing, an independent third-party security firm is engaged to perform additional security controls testing and provide an independent report to our executive team. This external assessment provides us and our Audit Committee with a comprehensive evaluation of our security posture. Our information security team plays a pivotal role in managing our cybersecurity risk. They oversee security controls and orchestrate our response to incidents—whether they originate internally or from our vendors, suppliers or other third parties that we conduct business with. As part of our vendor selection process, we evaluate cybersecurity risks in appropriate situations. Furthermore, we conduct tabletop exercises periodically. These simulations allow us to test our response strategies across various business functions, increasing preparedness for real-world incidents. When risks are identified through our processes, we analyze their potential impact on the Company and assess the likelihood of occurrence. Our monitoring efforts help us to timely mitigate and remediate risks and incidents. As part of our commitment to security awareness, information security training is mandatory for every employee and contractor. This ongoing compliance program reinforces best practices and helps to foster a security-conscious culture. To safeguard our systems, we regularly install and update anti-malware and endpoint detection and response software across all IT-managed systems and workstations. These measures help detect and prevent malicious code from compromising our infrastructure.We also engage third-party providers to bolster our cybersecurity risk management and strategy. Some provide ongoing assistance, including threat monitoring, mitigation strategies, and updates on emerging trends. Others provide targeted expertise, such as security assessments and forensic analysis.Cybersecurity GovernanceOur Board of Directors considers cybersecurity and other information technology risk as part of its risk oversight function. The Board of Directors receives an annual briefing, and the Audit Committee receives quarterly reports from our CSO on our cybersecurity risks and risk management program. Our cybersecurity team, led by our CSO, who reports directly to our Executive Vice President and Chief Operations Officer, is responsible for assessing and managing risks from cybersecurity threats. The CSO and his team have primary responsibility for our overall cybersecurity risk management program and supervise both our internal cybersecurity personnel and any retained external cybersecurity experts. Our CSO has over 20 years of security experience managing global security organizations including architecture, operations, strategy, applications, infrastructure, support and execution. The information security team collectively have decades of relevant experience in the industry and many hold various cybersecurity certifications such as a Certified Information Systems Security Professional or Certified Information Security Manager. Further, we invest in regular, ongoing cybersecurity training for our team.The CSO reports cybersecurity threats and incidents to the Audit Committee. These reports may be included in, or in addition to, his regular quarterly reports to the Audit Committee. In addition, pursuant to our internal procedures, in the event of a significant cybersecurity incident, members of senior management will report such threats and incidents in a timely manner directly to the Audit Committee and, when appropriate, to the full Board of Directors.We, like other technology companies operating in the current environment, have experienced cybersecurity incidents, but in the last three years we have not experienced an incident which has been determined to be material. For additional information regarding whether any risks from cybersecurity threats are reasonably likely to materially affect our company, including our business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition, please refer to “Cybersecurity risks could adversely affect our business and disrupt our operations” in Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.41Table of ContentsItem 2. PropertiesThe following table presents the approximate square footage of our significant owned and leased facilities as of February 1, 2025:(1)Lease terms expire in various years from 2025 through 2037; provided, however, that we have the option to extend certain leases past the current lease term. We have ceased-use lease facilities and subleased facilities of approximately 223,000 square feet in the United States that are excluded from the table above.We also lease smaller facilities in various international locations, which are occupied by administrative, sales, design and field application personnel. Based on the potential for future hiring, we believe that our current facilities in most locations will be adequate to meet our requirements at least through the next fiscal year.Item 3. Legal ProceedingsThe information set forth under “Note 8 – Commitments and Contingencies” in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K is incorporated herein by reference.

Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity SecuritiesMarket InformationOur shares of common stock are traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “MRVL.” Shares of Marvell Technology Group Ltd. (our prior parent company) began trading under the MRVL symbol on June 27, 2000, upon completion of an initial public offering. As of April 20, 2021, shares of Marvell Technology, Inc. began trading under the symbol MRVL.As of March 5, 2025, the approximate number of record holders of our common stock was 359 (not including beneficial owners of stock held in street name).Stock Price Performance GraphThis performance graph shall not be deemed “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Exchange Act or incorporated by reference into any filings under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.The graph below compares the cumulative total stockholder return of our common stock with the cumulative total return of the S&P 500 Index and the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (“PHLX”) since February 1, 2020 through February 1, 2025. The graph compares a $100 investment on February 1, 2020 in our common stock with a $100 investment on February 1, 2020 in each index and assumes that any dividends were reinvested. Stockholder returns over the indicated periods should not be considered indicative of future stock prices or stockholder returns.DividendsOur Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $0.06 per share payable to holders of our common stock in each quarter of fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023. As a result, we paid total cash dividends of $207.5 million in fiscal 2025, $206.8 million in fiscal 2024, and $204.4 million in fiscal 2023.43Table of ContentsFuture payment of a regular quarterly cash dividend on the Company’s common stock will be subject to, among other things, the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, the Company’s results of operations, cash balances and future cash requirements, financial condition, developments in ongoing litigation, statutory requirements under Delaware law and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. The Company’s dividend payments may change from time to time, and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare dividends at all or in any particular amounts.Recent Sales of Unregistered SecuritiesIn fiscal 2023, on December 2, 2022, the Company acquired all the equity interests of a private company for cash and stock. Pursuant to this transaction, 439,499 shares of Marvell common stock were issued, which shares are subject to forfeiture in some circumstances. The shares of Marvell common stock were issued in a private placement pursuant to Rule 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act.There were no sales of unregistered equity securities during fiscal 2024.On December 2, 2024, the Company announced that it has expanded its strategic collaboration with a customer, and in connection therewith the Company and the customer entered into a warrant and related transaction agreement under which, among other things, the Company agreed to issue to an affiliate of the customer (“Warrantholder”), a warrant (the “Warrant”) to acquire up to 4.2 million shares (the “Warrant Shares”) of Company common stock. Approximately 3.9 million Warrant Shares vest based on Company revenue through January 5, 2030 from Customer purchases of Company products, indirectly or directly, of which approximately 2.7 million Warrant Shares are for revenue from the Company’s custom artificial intelligence products and approximately 1.2 million Warrant Shares are for revenue from the Company’s other products. The balance of the Warrant Shares either vested upon issuance of the Warrant or are subject to time-based vesting. Subject to certain conditions, including vesting, the Warrant has a seven-year term and may be exercised, in whole or in part and for cash or on a net exercise basis, at any time before December 2, 2031, at a purchase price per share of Common Stock equal to $87.77 (the “Exercise Price”). The Exercise Price and the Warrant Shares issuable are subject to customary antidilution adjustments. The Warrant and the Warrant Shares have not been registered under the Act, in reliance on the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission promulgated thereunder. After the issuance of the Warrant, the customer sent the Company a notice of request to file shelf registration statement in accordance with the terms of the transaction agreement.Issuer Purchases of Equity SecuritiesThe following table presents details of our stock repurchases during the three months ended February 1, 2025 (in millions, except per share data):(1)The monthly periods presented above for the three months ended February 1, 2025, are based on our fiscal accounting periods which followed a 4-4-5 week fiscal accounting period.(2)On November 17, 2016, we announced that our Board of Directors had authorized a $1.0 billion stock repurchase program with no fixed expiration. The stock repurchase program replaced in its entirety the prior $3.3 billion stock repurchase program. On October 16, 2018, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized a $700.0 million addition to the balance of our existing stock repurchase program. On March 7, 2024, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized a $3.0 billion addition to the balance of its existing stock repurchase program. The stock repurchase program will be subject to market conditions, legal rules and regulations, and other factors and does not obligate us to repurchase any dollar amount or number of shares of our common stock and the repurchase program may be extended, modified, suspended or discontinued at any time.From August 2010 when our Board of Directors initially authorized a stock repurchase program through February 1, 2025, a total of 321.9 million shares have been repurchased under the Company’s stock repurchase program for a total $5.3 billion in cash and $2.6 billion remains available for future stock repurchases. 44Table of ContentsOur stock repurchase program is subject to market conditions, legal restrictions and regulations, and other factors, and does not obligate the Company to repurchase any dollar amount or number of shares of its common stock and the repurchase program may be extended, modified, suspended or discontinued at any time.Item 6. [Reserved]45Table of ContentsItem 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties, including those discussed under Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors.” These risks and uncertainties may cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements.OverviewWe are a leading supplier of data infrastructure semiconductor solutions, spanning the data center core to network edge. We are a fabless supplier of high-performance semiconductor products with core strengths in developing and scaling complex System-on-a-Chip architectures, integrating analog, mixed-signal and digital signal processing functionality. Leveraging leading intellectual property and deep system-level expertise, as well as highly innovative security firmware, our solutions are empowering the data economy and enabling the data center, enterprise networking, carrier infrastructure, consumer, and automotive/industrial end markets.Our fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period ending on the Saturday closest to January 31. Accordingly, every fifth or sixth fiscal year will have a 53-week period. The additional week in a 53-week year is added to the fourth quarter, making such quarter consist of 14 weeks. Fiscal 2024 had a 53-week period. Fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2023 each had a 52-week period.Net revenue in fiscal 2025 was $5.8 billion and was 5% higher than net revenue of $5.5 billion in fiscal 2024. This was due to an 88% increase in sales from the data center end market compared to fiscal 2024. The increase was partially offset by decreases in sales from the carrier infrastructure end market by 68%, from the enterprise networking end market by 49%, from the consumer end market by 49% and from the automotive/industrial end market by 17%.We have seen strong revenue growth from our data center end market, driven by robust demand for our interconnect and custom compute products from AI applications. In addition, following a period of inventory correction, we have started to see demand stabilize in our enterprise networking and carrier infrastructure end markets.To secure capacity over the long term, we have entered into capacity reservation arrangements with certain foundries and partners. See “Note 8 – Commitments and Contingencies” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. We expect that the U.S. government’s export restrictions on certain Chinese customers to continue to impact our revenue. Moreover, concerns that U.S. companies may not be reliable suppliers as a result of these and other actions has caused, and may in the future cause, some of our customers in China to amass large inventories of our products well in advance of need or cause some of our customers to replace our products in favor of products from other suppliers. Customers in China may also choose to develop indigenous solutions, as replacements for products that are subject to U.S. export controls. In addition, there may be indirect impacts to our business that we cannot easily quantify such as the fact that some of our other customers’ products which use our solutions may also be impacted by export restrictions. See also Part I, Item IA, “Risk Factors,” including, but not limited to, the risk detailed under the caption “Adverse changes in the political, regulatory and economic policies of governments in connection with trade with China and Chinese customers have reduced the demand for our products and damaged our business.”Government Incentives and Grants. We continue to benefit from lower income tax rates in certain jurisdictions through statutory elections or agreements with governmental agencies, which may include a commitment to maintain, or increase, headcount and business investment levels in those jurisdictions. The tax benefits associated with these reduced income tax rates are recorded through our income tax provision for the periods in which such incentive tax rates are effective. However, changes in international taxation, notably the enactment by numerous countries of minimum tax legislation modeled after the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s Pillar Two tax framework, could significantly reduce the income tax benefit associated with these tax incentives. In addition, certain jurisdictions in which we operate are pursuing alternative incentive programs, which operate within the Pillar Two tax framework. If we enter into such an incentive, it could have a significant effect on our future operating results and cash flows.We are currently in negotiation for such incentives with a governmental agency, and if agreement is reached, the incentive could have a significant effect on our operating results beginning in fiscal 2026 and continuing for the duration of the agreed-upon incentive period.46Table of ContentsRestructuring. We continuously evaluate our existing operations to increase operational efficiency, decrease costs and increase profitability. A restructuring plan was initiated during the third quarter of fiscal 2025 to increase research and development investment in the data center end market and reduce investment in new product development in other end markets including the cancellation of certain future product releases. We recognized $711.8 million of restructuring related charges for the year ended February 1, 2025, mainly comprised of impairment and write-off of acquired intangible assets, purchased technology licenses, inventories, property and equipment, and other non-current assets, as well as recognition of future contractual obligations, severance, other one-time termination benefits, and other costs. See “Note 4 – Restructuring” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.Capital Return Program. We remain committed to delivering stockholder value through our stock repurchase and dividend programs. Under the program authorized by our Board of Directors, we may repurchase shares of our common stock in the open-market or through privately negotiated transactions. The extent to which we repurchase our stock and the timing of such repurchases will depend upon market conditions, legal rules and regulations, and other corporate considerations, as determined by our management team. On March 7, 2024, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized a $3.0 billion addition to the balance of our existing stock repurchase program. During the year ended February 1, 2025, we repurchased 9.0 million shares of our common stock for $725.0 million. As of February 1, 2025, $2.6 billion remained available for future stock repurchases. Subsequent to fiscal 2025 year end through March 11, 2025, we repurchased 0.7 million shares of our common stock for $45.0 million. See “Note 10 – Stockholders’ Equity” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.We returned $932.5 million to stockholders in fiscal 2025 through $725.0 million in repurchases of shares of our common stock and $207.5 million in cash dividends. Cash and Short-Term Investments. Our cash and cash equivalents were $948.3 million at February 1, 2025, which were $2.5 million lower than our balance at February 3, 2024 of $950.8 million.Sales and Customer Composition. We regularly monitor the creditworthiness of our distributor and direct customers, and believe these distributors’ sales to diverse end customers and geographies further serve to mitigate our exposure to credit risk.Most of our sales are made to customers with operations located outside of the United States, primarily in Asia, and a majority of our products are manufactured outside the United States. Sales shipped to customers with operations in Asia represented approximately 75% of our net revenue in fiscal 2025, 70% of our net revenue in fiscal 2024 and 75% of our net revenue in fiscal 2023. Because many manufacturers and manufacturing subcontractors of our customers are located in Asia, we expect that most of our net revenue will continue to be represented by sales to our customers in that region. For risks related to our global operations, see Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” including but not limited to the risk detailed under the caption “We face additional risks due to the extent of our global operations since a majority of our products, and those of many of our customers, are manufactured and sold outside of the United States. The occurrence of any or a combination of the additional risks described below would significantly and negatively impact our business and results of operations.”The development process for our products is long, which may cause us to experience a delay between the time we incur expenses and the time revenue is generated from these expenditures. We anticipate that the rate of new orders may vary significantly from quarter to quarter. For risks related to our sales cycle, see Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” including but not limited to the risk detailed under the caption “We are subject to order and shipment uncertainties. If we are unable to accurately predict customer demand, we may hold excess or obsolete inventory, which would reduce our gross margin. Conversely, we may have insufficient inventory or be unable to obtain the supplies or contract manufacturing capacity to meet demand, which would result in lost revenue opportunities and potential loss of market share as well as damaged customer relationships.”47Table of ContentsCritical Accounting Policies and EstimatesThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, provisions for sales returns and allowances, inventory excess and obsolescence, goodwill and other intangible assets, restructuring, income taxes, litigation, and other contingencies. We base our estimates of the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances when these carrying values are not readily available from other sources. Actual results could differ from these estimates, and such differences could affect the results of operations reported in future periods. In the current macroeconomic environment, these estimates could require increased judgment and carry a higher degree of variability and volatility. We continue to monitor and assess our estimates in light of developments, and as events continue to evolve and additional information becomes available, our estimates may change materially in future periods. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. For further information on our significant accounting policies, see “Note 2 – Significant Accounting Policies” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. Under the revenue recognition standard, we apply the following five step approach: (1) identify the contract with a customer, (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (3) determine the transaction price, (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (5) recognize revenue when a performance obligation is satisfied.We enter into contracts that may include various combinations of products and services that are capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. To date, the majority of the revenue has been generated by sales of products as revenue from services has been insignificant. Performance obligations associated with product sales transactions are generally satisfied when control passes to customers upon shipment. Accordingly, product revenue is recognized at a point in time when control of the asset is transferred to the customer. We recognize revenue when we satisfy a performance obligation by transferring control of a product to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. For product revenue, the performance obligation is deemed to be the delivery of the product and therefore, the revenue is generally recognized upon shipment to customers, net of accruals for estimated sales returns and rebates. These estimates are based on historical returns, analysis of credit memo data and other known factors. Actual returns could differ from these estimates. We account for rebates by recording reductions to revenue for rebates in the same period that the related revenue is recorded. The amount of these reductions is based upon the terms agreed to with the customer. Some of our sales are made to distributors under agreements allowing for price protection, price discounts and limited rights of stock rotation on products unsold by the distributors. Control passes to the distributor upon shipment, and terms and payment by our distributors is not contingent on resale of the product. Product revenue on sales made to distributors is recognized upon shipment, net of estimated variable consideration. Variable consideration primarily consists of price discounts, price protection, rebates, and stock rotation programs and is estimated based on a portfolio approach using the expected value method derived from historical data, current economic conditions, and contractual terms. Actual variable consideration could differ from these estimates.A portion of our net revenue is derived from sales through third-party logistics providers who maintain warehouses in close proximity to our customers’ facilities. Revenue from sales through these third-party logistics providers is not recognized until the product is pulled from stock by the customer.Our products are generally subject to warranty, which provides for the estimated future costs of replacement upon shipment of the product. We generally warrant that our products sold to our customers will conform to our approved specifications and be free from defects in material and workmanship under normal use and conditions for one year. We may offer a longer warranty period in limited situations based on product type and negotiated warranty terms with certain customers. The warranty accrual is estimated primarily based on historical claims compared to historical revenues and assumes that we will have to replace products subject to a claim. From time to time, we become aware of specific warranty situations, and we record specific accruals to cover these exposures. 48Table of ContentsInventories. We value our inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value, cost being determined under the first-in, first-out method. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a reduction to the total carrying value of our inventory for any difference between cost and estimated net realizable value of inventory that is determined to be excess, obsolete or unsellable inventory based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements. The estimate of future demand is compared to our inventory levels, including open purchase commitments, to determine the amount, if any, of obsolete or excess inventory. Demand for our products can fluctuate significantly from period to period. A significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory on hand. In addition, our industry is characterized by rapid technological change, frequent new product development and rapid product obsolescence that could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand. Additionally, our estimates of future product demand and judgement to determine excess inventory may prove to be inaccurate, in which case we may have understated or overstated the reduction to the total carrying value of our inventory for excess and obsolete inventory. In the future, if our inventory is determined to be overvalued, we would be required to recognize such costs in our cost of goods sold at the time of such determination. Likewise, if our inventory is determined to be undervalued, we may have over-reported our cost of goods sold in previous periods and would be required to recognize additional gross margin at the time the related inventory is sold. Therefore, although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand, any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our results of operations.Accounting for Income Taxes. We estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating our actual tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the differing treatment of certain items for tax return and financial statement purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included in our consolidated balance sheets.We recognize income taxes using an asset and liability approach. This approach requires the recognition of taxes payable or refundable for the current year, and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns. The measurement of current and deferred taxes is based on provisions of the enacted tax law and the effects of future changes in tax laws or rates are not anticipated.Evaluating the need for a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets requires judgment and analysis of all available positive and negative evidence, including recent earnings history and cumulative losses in recent years, reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies to determine whether all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Forming a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed is difficult when there is negative evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years. Using available evidence and judgment, we establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, when it is determined that it is more likely than not that they will not be realized. Valuation allowances have been provided primarily against U.S. federal and state research and development credits and certain acquired net operating losses and deferred tax assets of foreign subsidiaries. A change in the assessment of the realizability of deferred tax assets may significantly affect our tax provision in the period in which a change of assessment occurs. Taxes due on Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (“GILTI”) inclusions in U.S. are recognized as a current period expense when incurred.As a multinational corporation, we conduct our business in many countries and are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions. The taxation of our business is subject to the application of various and sometimes conflicting tax laws and regulations as well as multinational tax conventions. Our effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic distribution of our worldwide earnings or losses, the tax laws and regulations in various jurisdictions, the availability of tax incentives, tax credits and loss carryforwards, and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies, which includes our estimates of the fair value of our intellectual property. The application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation, judgment and uncertainty. Tax laws themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy, changes in legislation, and the evolution of regulations and court rulings and tax audits. There can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcome of audits, and the amounts ultimately paid on resolution of audits could be significantly different than the amounts previously included in our income tax expense and therefore, could have a significant effect on our tax provision, results of operations, and cash flows. Consequently, taxing authorities may impose tax assessments or judgments against us that could significantly affect our tax liability and/or our effective income tax rate.49Table of ContentsWe are subject to income tax audits by the respective tax authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate. We recognize the effect of income tax positions only if these positions are more likely than not to be sustained. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized. Changes in judgment regarding the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions are reflected in the period in which the change occurs. We record interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves the inherent uncertainty associated with complex tax laws. We believe we have adequately provided for in our financial statements additional taxes that we estimate to be required to be paid as a result of such examinations. While we believe that we have adequately provided for all tax positions, amounts asserted by tax authorities could be greater or less than our accrued position. Unpaid tax liabilities, including the interest and penalties, are released pursuant to a final settlement with tax authorities, completion of audit or expiration of various statutes of limitations. The significant jurisdictions in which we may be subject to examination by tax authorities throughout the world include Germany, India, Israel, Singapore, and the United States.The recognition and measurement of current taxes payable or refundable, and deferred tax assets and liabilities require that we make certain estimates and judgments. Changes to these estimates or judgments may have a significant effect on our income tax provision in a future period.Long-Lived Assets and Intangible Assets. We assess the impairment of long-lived assets and intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of long-lived assets may not be recoverable. Circumstances which could trigger a review include, but are not limited to the following:•significant decreases in the market price of the asset;•significant adverse changes in the business climate or legal factors;•accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of the asset;•current period cash flow or operating losses combined with a history of losses or a forecast of continuing losses associated with the use of the asset; and•current expectation that the asset will more likely than not be sold or disposed of significantly before the end of its estimated useful life.Whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount of long-lived assets and intangible assets may not be recoverable, we estimate the future cash flows, undiscounted and without interest charges, expected to be generated by the asset from its use or eventual disposition. If the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of those assets, we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets. Significant management judgment is required in the forecasts of future operating results that are used in the discounted cash flow method of valuation. These significant judgments may include future expected revenue, expenses, capital expenditures and other costs, discount rates and whether or not alternative uses are available for impacted long-lived assets.Goodwill. We record goodwill when the consideration paid for a business acquisition exceeds the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is measured and tested for impairment annually on the last business day of our fiscal fourth quarter, and more frequently, if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the fair value of the reporting unit may be below its carrying amount. We have identified that our business operates as a single operating segment and as a single reporting unit for the purpose of goodwill impairment testing. When testing goodwill for impairment, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount or we may determine to proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test.Factors we consider important in the qualitative assessment which could trigger a goodwill impairment review include;•significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results;•significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business;•significant negative industry or economic trends;•a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period; and•a significant change in our market capitalization relative to our net book value.50Table of ContentsIf we assess qualitative factors and conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, or if we determine not to use the qualitative assessment, then a quantitative impairment test is performed. The quantitative impairment test requires comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. An impairment exists if the fair value of the reporting unit is lower than its carrying value. We would record an impairment loss in the fiscal quarter in which an impairment determination is made. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions.As of the last day of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, we performed our annual impairment assessment for testing goodwill. A quantitative assessment was performed. Based on our assessment, we determined there was no goodwill impairment.Business Combinations. We allocate the fair value of the purchase consideration of a business acquisition to the tangible assets, liabilities, and intangible assets acquired, including in-process research and development (“IPR&D”), based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. IPR&D is initially capitalized at fair value as an intangible asset with an indefinite life and assessed for impairment thereafter. When an IPR&D project is completed, the IPR&D is reclassified as an amortizable purchased intangible asset and amortized over the asset’s estimated useful life. Our valuation of acquired assets and assumed liabilities requires significant estimates, especially with respect to intangible assets. The valuation of intangible assets, in particular, requires that we use valuation techniques such as the income approach. The income approach includes the use of a discounted cash flow model, which includes discounted cash flow scenarios and requires the following significant estimates: future expected revenue, expenses, capital expenditures and other costs, and discount rates. We estimate the fair value based upon assumptions we believe to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. Estimates associated with the accounting for acquisitions may change as additional information becomes available regarding the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Acquisition-related expenses and related restructuring costs are recognized separately from the business combination and are expensed as incurred.Results of Operations Years Ended February 1, 2025 and February 3, 2024The following table sets forth information derived from our consolidated statements of operations expressed as a percentage of net revenue:51Table of ContentsNet RevenueOur net revenue for fiscal 2025 increased by $259.6 million compared to net revenue for fiscal 2024. This was primarily due to an 88% increase in sales from the data center end market which benefited from strong AI demand. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in sales from the carrier infrastructure end market by 68%, from the enterprise networking end market by 49%, from the consumer end market by 49%, and from the automotive/industrial end market by 17%, which have been navigating inventory corrections and soft industry demand.Cost of Goods Sold and Gross ProfitCost of goods sold as a percentage of net revenue was relatively flat for fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024. Cost of goods sold in fiscal 2025 was impacted by impairment charges of $357.9 million for acquired intangible assets, inventories, property and equipment, and other non-current assets associated with restructuring actions during fiscal 2025. See “Note 4 – Restructuring” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Cost of goods sold in fiscal 2024 was impacted by charges for product related claim matters, that were fully resolved in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. As a result, gross margin for fiscal 2025 decreased 0.3 percentage points compared to fiscal 2024.Research and DevelopmentResearch and development expense increased by $54.2 million in fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024. The increase was primarily due to $34.0 million of higher employee compensation and related costs and $33.1 million of higher engineering design related costs. The increases were partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation of $15.5 million.Selling, General and AdministrativeSelling, general and administrative expense decreased by $35.8 million in fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024. The decrease was primarily due to charges for an intellectual property matter during fiscal 2024, as well as $22.7 million of lower depreciation and amortization expense. The decreases were partially offset by higher employee compensation and related costs of $9.8 million.52Table of ContentsStock-Based Compensation ExpenseStock-based compensation expense decreased by $12.4 million in fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024. Stock-based compensation under research and development and cost of goods sold decreased by $15.5 million and $1.8 million, respectively, and stock-based compensation under selling, general and administrative increased by $4.9 million. The overall decrease was primarily due to a decrease in expense associated with our employee stock purchase plan.Restructuring Related ChargesWe recognized $353.9 million of restructuring related charges in fiscal 2025 as we continued to evaluate our existing operations to increase operational efficiency, decrease costs and increase profitability. Restructuring charges for fiscal 2025 were mainly comprised of impairment and write-off of purchased technology licenses and property and equipment, as well as recognition of future contractual obligations, severance, other one-time termination benefits, and other costs. See “Note 4 – Restructuring” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.Interest and Other Loss, NetInterest and other loss, net decreased by $16.6 million in fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024. The net decrease was primarily due to a decrease in interest expense and an increase in interest income. The decrease was partially offset by higher factoring fees for the sales of receivables in fiscal 2025 as compared to fiscal 2024, as well as lower net gains recognized from equity investments.Provision (Benefit) for Income TaxesThe income tax benefit for fiscal 2025 differs from the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21% as a result of foreign income inclusions in the U.S., a portion of our earnings or losses being taxed or benefited at rates lower than the U.S. statutory rate, research and development credit generation, and deductions related to stock compensation.53Table of ContentsThe income tax expense for fiscal 2024 differs from the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21% as a result of foreign income inclusions in the U.S., a portion of our earnings or losses being taxed or benefited at rates lower than the U.S. statutory rate, research and development credit generation, and disallowed deductions related to non-deductible compensation. Further, during fiscal 2024, guidance was issued by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service in connection with the capitalization of research and development expenditures. As a result of this guidance, certain costs are currently deductible rather than capitalizable, which resulted in a reduction to our income tax payable and an increase in our deferred tax assets for which we maintain a full valuation allowance.Our provision for incomes taxes may be affected by changes in the geographic mix of earnings with different applicable tax rates, acquisitions, changes in the realizability of deferred tax assets, accruals related to contingent tax liabilities and period-to-period changes in such accruals, the results of income tax audits, the expiration of statutes of limitations, the implementation of tax planning strategies, tax rulings, court decisions, settlements with tax authorities and changes in tax laws and regulations. It is also possible that significant negative evidence may become available that causes us to conclude that a valuation allowance is needed on certain of our deferred tax assets, which would adversely affect our income tax provision in the period of such change in judgment.Several countries in which we operate have enacted, or have committed to enact, legislation based on the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s 15% global minimum tax regime. The enacted legislation did not have a significant effect on our provision for income taxes for fiscal 2025. However, Singapore has enacted legislation based on the Pillar Two tax framework, including a 15% minimum top up tax, for years beginning on or after January 1, 2025. This legislation is effective for us in fiscal 2026 and could significantly affect our provision for income taxes beginning in fiscal 2026. Additionally, please see the information in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” under the caption “Changes in existing taxation benefits, tax rules or tax practices may adversely affect our financial results.”Our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 3, 2024 includes a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended January 28, 2023 and year-to-year comparisons between the years ended February 3, 2024 and January 28, 2023 in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”Liquidity and Capital ResourcesOur principal source of liquidity as of February 1, 2025 consisted of approximately $948.3 million of cash and cash equivalents, of which approximately $716.9 million was held by subsidiaries outside of the United States, a portion of which are deemed to be indefinitely reinvested. We manage our worldwide cash requirements by, among other things, reviewing available funds held by our foreign subsidiaries and the cost effectiveness by which those funds can be accessed in the United States. See “Note 12 – Income Taxes” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.As of February 1, 2025, we had total borrowings outstanding of $4.1 billion, consisting of $3.5 billion of senior notes outstanding and $590.6 million outstanding under the 2026 Term Loan.For the year ended February 1, 2025, we repaid $109.4 million of the principal outstanding of the 5-Year Tranche Loan (“2026 Term Loan”).We have a revolving credit facility with a borrowing capacity of $1.0 billion and a 5-year term (“2023 Revolving Credit Facility”). As of February 1, 2025, the 2023 Revolving Credit Facility is undrawn and is available for draw down through April 14, 2028.For a description of our contractual obligations including debt, purchase commitments, and leases, see “Note 7 – Debt,” “Note 8 – Commitments and Contingencies” and “Note 9 – Leases” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, see “Note 12 – Income Taxes” regarding tax related contingencies and uncertain tax positions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We generally expect to satisfy these commitments with cash on hand and cash provided by operating activities.We may elect to factor trade accounts receivable from time to time as part of our overall liquidity and working capital management strategy. During the year ended February 1, 2025, we generated cash from operations from the sale of certain trade accounts receivable on a non-recourse basis to a third-party financial institution pursuant to a factoring arrangement. See “Note 15 – Supplemental Financial Information” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.54Table of ContentsWe believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, together with cash generated from operations, and funds from our 2023 Revolving Credit Facility will be sufficient to cover our working capital needs, capital expenditures, investment requirements, any declared dividends, repurchases of our common stock and commitments (including those discussed in “Note 8 – Commitments and Contingencies” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) for at least the next twelve months. Our capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our rate of sales growth, market acceptance of our products, costs of securing access to adequate manufacturing capacity, the timing and extent of research and development projects and increases in operating expenses, all of which are subject to uncertainty.To the extent that our existing cash and cash equivalents, together with cash generated by operations, and funds available under our 2023 Revolving Credit Facility are insufficient to fund our future activities, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financing. We may also acquire additional businesses, purchase assets or enter into other strategic arrangements in the future, which could also require us to seek debt or equity financing. Additional equity financing or convertible debt financing may be dilutive to our current stockholders. If we elect to raise additional funds, we may not be able to obtain such funds on a timely basis or on acceptable terms, if at all. In addition, the equity or debt securities that we issue may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to our common stock.Future payment of a regular quarterly cash dividend on our common stock and our planned repurchases of common stock will be subject to, among other things, the best interests of the Company and our stockholders, our results of operations, cash balances and future cash requirements, financial condition, developments in ongoing litigation, statutory requirements under Delaware law, U.S. securities laws and regulations, market conditions and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. Our dividend payments and repurchases of common stock may change from time to time, and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare dividends or repurchase stock at all or in any particular amounts.Cash Flows from Operating ActivitiesNet cash provided by operating activities was $1.7 billion for fiscal 2025 compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $1.4 billion for fiscal 2024. We had a net loss of $885.0 million adjusted for the following non-cash items: amortization of acquired intangible assets of $1.1 billion, stock-based compensation expense of $597.4 million, restructuring related impairment charges of $528.8 million, depreciation and amortization of $304.3 million, deferred income tax benefit of $111.9 million and $65.9 million net loss from other non-cash items. Cash inflow from working capital of $129.1 million for fiscal 2025 was primarily driven by a decrease in accounts receivable, and increases in accounts payable, accrued employee compensation, and accrued liabilities and other non-current liabilities, partially offset by an increase in inventories. The decrease in accounts receivable was primarily due to better shipment linearity and increase in distribution reserves on stronger demand. The increase in accounts payable was primarily due to the timing of payments. The increase in accrued employee compensation was primarily due to bonus accrual. The increase in accrued liabilities and other non-current liabilities was primarily driven by higher restructuring accruals, partially offset by lower ship and debit claims accrual due to lower inventory balances at distributors as a result of increased sell through, and decreases in litigation and interest accrual. The increase in inventories was primarily to support improving demand environment.Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.4 billion for fiscal 2024 compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $1.3 billion for fiscal 2023. We had a net loss of $933.4 million adjusted for the following non-cash items: amortization of acquired intangible assets of $1.1 billion, stock-based compensation expense of $609.8 million, depreciation and amortization of $299.8 million, deferred income tax expense of $150.8 million, restructuring related impairment charges of $32.9 million, and $54.9 million net loss from other non-cash items. Cash inflow from working capital of $57.8 million for fiscal 2024 was primarily driven by a decrease in accounts receivable, and a decrease in inventories, partially offset by cash outflows due to an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets, and a decrease in accounts payable. The decrease in accounts receivable was primarily due to timing of billing and collections and the impact of factoring of receivables. The decrease in inventory was a result of utilizing previously built buffers. The increase in prepaid expenses and other assets was primarily due to prepayments on supply capacity reservation agreements net of refunds, and an increase in ship and debit reserve. The decrease in accounts payable was primarily due to the timing of payments.Cash Flows from Investing ActivitiesNet cash used in investing activities of $300.7 million in fiscal 2025 was primarily driven by the purchases of property and equipment of $284.6 million.Net cash used in investing activities of $350.5 million in fiscal 2024 was primarily driven by the purchases of property and equipment of $336.3 million.55Table of ContentsCash Flows from Financing ActivitiesNet cash used in financing activities of $1.4 billion in fiscal 2025 was primarily attributable to $725.0 million repurchases of common stock, $274.9 million for withholding tax paid on behalf of employees for net share settlement, $207.5 million payment for our quarterly dividends, $153.6 million payments for technology license obligations, and $109.4 million repayment of debt principal. These outflows were partially offset by $87.6 million proceeds from the issuance of our common stock under our equity incentive plans.Net cash used in financing activities of $980.2 million in fiscal 2024 was primarily attributable to $1.6 billion repayment of debt principal, $223.7 million for withholding tax paid on behalf of employees for net share settlement, $206.8 million payment for our quarterly dividends, $150.3 million payments for technology license obligations, and $150.0 million repurchases of common stock. These outflows were partially offset by $1.3 billion proceeds from issuance of debt, and $99.2 million proceeds from the issuance of our common stock under our equity incentive plans.Recent Accounting PronouncementsPlease see “Note 2 – Significant Accounting Policies - Recent Accounting Pronouncements” in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Related Party TransactionsNone.Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskInterest Rate Risk. With our outstanding debt, we are exposed to various forms of market risk, including the potential losses arising from adverse changes in interest rates on our outstanding 2026 Term Loan. See “Note 7 – Debt” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. A hypothetical increase or decrease in the interest rate by 1 percentage point could result in an increase or decrease in annual interest expense by approximately $5.1 million.We maintain an investment policy that requires minimum credit ratings, diversification of credit risk and limits the long-term interest rate risk by requiring effective maturities of generally less than five years. We typically invest our excess cash primarily in highly liquid debt instruments including money market funds and time deposits. Investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities carry a degree of interest rate risk. Fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall. There were no such investments on hand at February 1, 2025, aside from cash and cash equivalents.Foreign Currency Exchange Risk. All of our sales and the majority of our expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars. Since we operate in many countries, a percentage of our international operational expenses are denominated in foreign currencies and exchange volatility could positively or negatively impact those operating costs. Increases in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies could make our products more expensive, which could negatively impact our ability to compete. Conversely, decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies could result in our suppliers raising their prices to continue doing business with us. Additionally, we may hold certain assets and liabilities, including potential tax liabilities, in local currency on our consolidated balance sheets. These tax liabilities would be settled in local currency. Therefore, foreign exchange gains and losses from remeasuring the tax liabilities are recorded to interest and other loss, net. We do not believe that foreign exchange volatility has a significant effect on our current business or results of operations. However, fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a greater effect on our business or results of operations in the future to the extent our expenses increasingly become denominated in foreign currencies.We may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, forecasted future cash flows and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. However, we may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to, accounting considerations and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures.To provide an assessment of the foreign currency exchange risk associated with our foreign currency exposures within operating expense, we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the effect that an adverse change in exchange rates would have on our financial statements. If the U.S. dollar weakened by 10%, our operating expenses could increase by approximately 2%.56Table of ContentsItem 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary DataINDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS57Table of ContentsREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRMTo the stockholders and the Board of Directors of Marvell Technology, Inc.Opinion on the Financial StatementsWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Marvell Technology, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of February 1, 2025 and February 3, 2024, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, stockholders' equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended February 1, 2025, and the related notes and the schedules listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of February 1, 2025, and February 3, 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended February 1, 2025, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of February 1, 2025, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated March 12, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.Basis for OpinionThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.Critical Audit MatterThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.Inventories – Management Judgments Regarding Excess and Obsolete Inventory Reserves — Refer to Note 2 to the financial statements.Critical Audit Matter Description Management writes down excess inventories based upon a regular analysis of inventory on hand compared to forecasted demand. Management’s estimates of forecasted demand are based upon analysis and assumptions including, but not limited to, expected product lifecycles and development plans, expected customer orders, projected and current market conditions, historical usage by product, and customer backlog. As of February 1, 2025, the Company’s consolidated inventories balance was $1,029.7 million.We identified inventory valuation as a critical audit matter because of the significant assumptions management makes with regards to estimating the excess write-down and the potential impact of those judgments. Specifically, due to assumptions related to forecasted demand and market conditions, performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s estimates of forecasted demand required a high degree of auditor judgment and increased audit effort.58How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the AuditOur audit procedures related to management’s estimates of forecasted demand used in the valuation of inventory included the following, among others: •We tested the effectiveness of internal controls over management’s provisions for excess and obsolete inventories, including internal controls designed to review and approve forecasted demand and the underlying assumptions regarding expected product lifecycles, product development plans, expected customer orders, projected and current market conditions, and historical usage by product.•We evaluated management’s ability to accurately estimate forecasted demand by comparing estimates made in prior periods to the historical actual results for those same periods.•We made inquiries of business unit managers throughout the period as well as executives, sales and marketing, and operations personnel about the expected product lifecycles and product development plans and historical usage by product and compared expectations to actual developments over the period.•We selected a sample of inventory products and tested the forecasted demand by comparing internal and external information (e.g., historical usage, contracts, communications with customers, market conditions, etc.) with the Company’s forecast.•We considered, when relevant, the existence of contradictory evidence based on reading of internal financial and operational information used by management and the board of directors, Company press releases, and analysts' reports, as well as our observations and inquires as to changes within the business and evidence obtained through other areas of the audit./s/ Deloitte & Touche LLPSan Jose, CaliforniaMarch 12, 2025We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2016.59Table of ContentsMARVELL TECHNOLOGY, INC.CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS(In millions, except par value per share)See accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.60Table of ContentsMARVELL TECHNOLOGY, INC.CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS(In millions, except per share amounts)See accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.61Table of ContentsMARVELL TECHNOLOGY, INC.CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE LOSS(In millions)See accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.62Table of ContentsMARVELL TECHNOLOGY, INC.CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY(In millions, except per share amounts)See accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.63Table of ContentsMARVELL TECHNOLOGY, INC.CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS(In millions)See accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.64Table of ContentsMARVELL TECHNOLOGY, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSNote 1 — Basis of PresentationThe CompanyMarvell Technology, Inc., and its subsidiaries (the “Company”), is a leading supplier of data infrastructure semiconductor solutions, spanning the data center core to network edge. The Company is a fabless supplier of high-performance semiconductor with core strengths in developing and scaling complex System-on-a-Chip architectures, integrating analog, mixed-signal and digital signal processing functionality. The Company also leverages leading intellectual property and deep system-level expertise, as well as highly innovative security firmware. The Company’s solutions are empowering the data economy and enabling the data center, enterprise networking, carrier infrastructure, consumer, and automotive/industrial end markets. The Company is incorporated in Delaware, United States. Basis of PresentationThe Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period ending on the Saturday closest to January 31. Accordingly, every fifth or sixth fiscal year will have a 53-week period. The additional week in a 53-week year is added to the fourth quarter, making such quarter consist of 14 weeks. Fiscal 2024 had a 53-week period. Fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2023 each had a 52-week period. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation. All dollar amounts in the financial statements and tables in these notes, except per share amounts, are stated in millions of U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted.Note 2 — Significant Accounting PoliciesUse of EstimatesThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, provisions for sales returns and allowances, inventory excess and obsolescence, goodwill and other intangible assets, business combinations, restructuring, income taxes, litigation and other contingencies. Actual results could differ from these estimates, and such differences could affect the results of operations reported in future periods. In the current macroeconomic environment, these estimates could require increased judgment and carry a higher degree of variability and volatility. As events continue to evolve and additional information becomes available, these estimates may change materially in future periods.Principles of ConsolidationThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The functional currency of the Company and its subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar.Cash and Cash EquivalentsThe Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less from the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on deposit with banks and time deposits.Investments in Equity Securities The Company has equity investments in privately-held companies. If the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence over the investee, but not control, the Company accounts for the investment under the equity method. If the Company does not have the ability to exercise significant influence over the operations of the investee, the Company accounts for the investment under the measurement alternative method. Investments in privately-held companies are included in other non-current assets and subject to impairment review on an ongoing basis. Investments are considered impaired when the fair value is below the investment’s cost basis. This assessment is based on a qualitative and quantitative analysis, including, but not limited to, the investee’s revenue and earnings trends, available cash and liquidity, and the status of the investee’s products and the related market for such products.65Table of ContentsMARVELL TECHNOLOGY, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)Concentration of Credit Risk and Significant CustomersFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to a significant concentration of credit risk consist principally of cash equivalents and accounts receivable. Cash and cash equivalents are maintained with high-quality financial institutions, the composition and maturities of which are regularly monitored by management. The Company believes that the concentration of credit risk in its trade receivables is substantially mitigated by the Company’s credit evaluation process, relatively short collection terms and the high level of credit worthiness of its customers. For customers including distributors and direct customers, the Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of their financial conditions and limits the amount of credit extended when deemed necessary based upon payment history and their current credit worthiness, but generally requires no collateral. The Company regularly reviews the allowance for credit losses by considering factors such as historical experience, credit quality, reasonable and supportable forecasts, age of the accounts receivable balances and current economic conditions that may affect a customer’s ability to pay.The Company’s accounts receivable was concentrated with four customers at February 1, 2025, who comprise a total of 72% of gross accounts receivable, compared with three customers at February 3, 2024, who represented 67% of gross accounts receivable, respectively. This presentation is at the customer consolidated level.Net revenue attributable to significant customers including both distributor and direct customers whose revenues represented 10% or more of total net revenue is presented in the following table:*Less than 10% of net revenue.The Company continuously monitors the creditworthiness of its distributor and direct customers, and believes the distributors’ sales to diverse end customers and to diverse geographies further serve to mitigate the Company’s exposure to credit risk.InventoriesInventory is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, cost being determined under the first-in, first-out method. The total carrying value of the Company’s inventory is reduced for any difference between cost and estimated net realizable value of inventory that is determined to be excess, obsolete or unsellable inventory based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If actual future demand for the Company’s products is less than currently forecasted, the Company may be required to write inventory down below the current carrying value. Once the carrying value of inventory is reduced, it is maintained until the product to which it relates is sold or otherwise disposed. Inventoriable shipping and handling costs are classified as a component of cost of goods sold in the consolidated statements of operations.Property and Equipment, NetProperty and equipment, net, are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which ranges from 2 to 7 years for machinery and equipment, and 3 to 4 years for computer software, and furniture and fixtures. Buildings are depreciated over an estimated useful life of 30 years and building improvements are depreciated over estimated useful lives of 15 years. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset.66Table of ContentsMARVELL TECHNOLOGY, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)GoodwillGoodwill is recorded when the consideration paid for a business acquisition exceeds the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is measured and tested for impairment annually on the last business day of the fiscal fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable. The Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount or the Company may determine to proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test.If the Company assesses qualitative factors and concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount or if the Company determines not to use the qualitative assessment, then a quantitative impairment test is performed. The quantitative impairment test requires comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. The Company has identified that its business operates as a single operating segment and as a single reporting unit for the purpose of goodwill impairment testing. An impairment exists if the fair value of the reporting unit is lower than its carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit is lower than its carrying value, the Company would record an impairment loss in the fiscal quarter in which the determination is made.Long-Lived Assets and Intangible AssetsThe Company assesses the impairment of long-lived assets and intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of long-lived assets may not be recoverable. The Company estimates the future cash flows, undiscounted and without interest charges, expected to be generated by the assets from its use or eventual disposition. If the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of those assets, the Company recognizes an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets.Acquisition-related identified intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated economic lives, except for certain customer contracts and related relationships, which are amortized using an accelerated method of amortization over the expected customer lives. In-process research and development (“IPR&D”) is not amortized until the completion of the related development.LeasesThe Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Operating lease ROU assets also include any initial direct costs and prepayments less lease incentives. Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise such options. As the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses its collateralized incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the lease commencement date, including lease term, in determining the present value of lease payments. Lease expense for these leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.Foreign Currency TransactionsThe functional currency of all of the Company’s non-United States (“U.S.”) operations is the U.S. dollar. Monetary accounts maintained in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are re-measured using the foreign exchange rate at the balance sheet date. Operational accounts and nonmonetary balance sheet accounts are measured and recorded at the exchange rate in effect at the date of the transaction. The effects of foreign currency re-measurement are reported in current operations.Revenue RecognitionProduct revenue is recognized at a point in time when control of the asset is transferred to the customer. Substantially all of the Company’s revenue is derived from product sales. The Company recognizes revenue when it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control of a product to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. For product revenue, the performance obligation is deemed to be the delivery of the product and therefore, the revenue is generally recognized upon shipment to customers, net of accruals for estimated sales returns and rebates. These estimates are based on historical returns, analysis of credit memo data and other known factors. The Company accounts for rebates by recording reductions to revenue for rebates in the same period that the related revenue is recorded. The amount of these reductions is based upon the terms agreed to with the customer. Product revenue on sales made to distributors is recognized upon shipment, net of estimated variable consideration. Variable consideration primarily consists of price discounts, price protection, rebates, and stock rotation programs and is estimated based on a portfolio approach using the expected value method derived from historical data, current economic conditions, and contractual terms.67Table of ContentsMARVELL TECHNOLOGY, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)A portion of the Company’s net revenue is derived from sales through third-party logistics providers who maintain warehouses in close proximity to the Company’s customers’ facilities. Revenue from sales through these third-party logistics providers is not recognized until the product is pulled from stock by the customer.The Company’s products are generally subject to warranty, which provides for the estimated future costs of replacement upon shipment of the product. The Company generally warrants that its products sold to its customers will conform to its approved specifications and be free from defects in material and workmanship under normal use and conditions for one year. The Company may offer a longer warranty period in limited situations based on product type and negotiated warranty terms with certain customers. The warranty accrual is estimated primarily based on historical claims compared to historical revenues and assumes that the Company will have to replace products subject to a claim. From time to time, the Company becomes aware of specific warranty situations, and it records specific accruals to cover these exposures.Business CombinationsThe Company allocates the fair value of the purchase consideration of its business acquisitions to the tangible assets, liabilities, and intangible assets acquired, including IPR&D, based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. IPR&D is initially capitalized at fair value as an intangible asset with an indefinite life and assessed for impairment thereafter. When an IPR&D project is completed, the IPR&D is reclassified as an amortizable purchased intangible asset and amortized over the asset’s estimated useful life. Acquisition-related expenses and related restructuring costs are recognized separately from the business combination and are expensed as incurred.Stock-Based CompensationStock-based compensation is measured at the grant date, based on the fair value of the award, and is recognized as expense over the requisite service vesting period. The Company amortizes stock-based compensation expense for time-based awards under the straight-line attribution method over the vesting period. Stock-based compensation expense for performance-based awards is recognized when it becomes probable that the performance conditions will be met. The Company amortizes stock-based compensation expense for performance-based awards using the accelerated method.The fair value of each restricted stock unit is estimated based on the market price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant less the expected dividend yield.The Company estimates the fair value of stock purchase awards on the date of grant using the Black Scholes option-pricing model. The fair value of performance-based awards based on total shareholder return (“TSR”) are estimated on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation model.Forfeitures are recorded when they occur. Previously recognized expense is reversed for the portion of awards forfeited prior to vesting as and when forfeitures occur.Comprehensive LossComprehensive loss, net of tax is comprised of net loss and net change in unrealized gains and losses on cash flow hedges for fiscal 2025 and 2024. For fiscal 2023, there were no reconciling differences between net loss and comprehensive loss.Accounting for Income TaxesThe Company estimates its income taxes in the jurisdictions in which it operates. This process involves estimating the Company’s actual tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the differing treatment of certain items for tax return and financial statement purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.The Company recognizes income taxes using an asset and liability approach. This approach requires the recognition of taxes payable or refundable for the current year, and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company’s consolidated financial statements or tax returns. The measurement of current and deferred taxes is based on provisions of the enacted tax law and the effects of future changes in tax laws or rates are not anticipated.68Table of ContentsMARVELL TECHNOLOGY, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)Evaluating the need for a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets requires judgment and analysis of all available positive and negative evidence, including recent earnings history and cumulative losses in recent years, reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies to determine whether all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Forming a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed is difficult when there is negative evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years. Using available evidence and judgment, the Company establishes a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, when it is determined that it is more likely than not that they will not be realized. Valuation allowances have been provided primarily against U.S. federal and state research and development credits and certain acquired net operating losses and deferred tax assets of foreign subsidiaries. A change in the assessment of the realizability of deferred tax assets may significantly affect the Company’s tax provision in the period in which a change of assessment occurs. Taxes due on Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (“GILTI”) inclusions in U.S. are recognized as a current period expense when incurred.As a multinational corporation, the Company conducts its business in many countries and is subject to taxation in many jurisdictions. The taxation of the business is subject to the application of various and sometimes conflicting tax laws and regulations as well as multinational tax conventions. The Company’s effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic distribution of the Company’s worldwide earnings or losses, the tax laws and regulations in various jurisdictions, the availability of tax incentives, tax credits and loss carryforwards, and the effectiveness of the Company’s tax planning strategies, including the Company’s estimates of the fair value of its intellectual property. The application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation, judgment and uncertainty. Tax laws themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy, changes in legislation, and the evolution of regulations and court rulings and tax audits. There can be no assurance that the Company will accurately predict the outcome of audits, and the amounts ultimately paid on resolution of audits could be significantly different than the amounts previously included in the Company’s income tax expense and therefore, could have a significant effect on its tax provision, results of operations, and cash flows. Consequently, taxing authorities may impose tax assessments or judgments against us that could significantly affect the Company’s tax liability and/or its effective income tax rate.The Company is subject to income tax audits by the respective tax authorities in the jurisdictions in which it operates. The Company recognizes the effect of income tax positions only if these positions are more likely than not to be sustained. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized. Changes in judgment regarding the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions are reflected in the period in which the change occurs. The Company records interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. The calculation of the Company’s tax liabilities involves the inherent uncertainty associated with complex tax laws. The Company believes it has adequately provided for in its financial statements additional taxes that it estimates may be required to be paid as a result of such examinations. While the Company believes that it has adequately provided for all tax positions, amounts asserted by tax authorities could be greater or less than its accrued position. Unpaid tax liabilities, including the interest and penalties, are released pursuant to a final settlement with tax authorities, completion of audit or expiration of various statutes of limitations. The significant jurisdictions in which the Company may be subject to examination by tax authorities throughout the world include Germany, India, Israel, Singapore, and the United States.The recognition and measurement of current taxes payable or refundable, and deferred tax assets and liabilities require that the Company make certain estimates and judgments. Changes to these estimates or judgments may have a significant effect on the Company’s tax provision in a future period.Recent Accounting PronouncementsAccounting Pronouncements Recently AdoptedIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280) to improve reportable segment disclosures. The update requires disclosure of incremental segment information on an annual and interim basis. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, and requires retrospective application to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. The Company adopted this standard for the fiscal year ended February 1, 2025. See “Note 14 – Segment and Geographic Information” for further information. The adoption of this standard did not have a significant effect on the Company’s results of operations or financial condition. 69Table of ContentsMARVELL TECHNOLOGY, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet EffectiveIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740) to improve income tax disclosures to enhance transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosure. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024 with updates to be applied on a prospective basis with the option to apply the standard retrospectively. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact that this new standard will have on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income—Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40) requiring disaggregated disclosure of certain expense captions into specified categories in the notes to financial statements on an annual and interim basis. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026 with updates to be applied on a prospective basis with the option to apply the standard retrospectively. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact that this new standard will have on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.Note 3 — RevenueDisaggregation of RevenueThe majority of the Company’s revenue is generated from sales of the Company’s products.The following table summarizes net revenue disaggregated by end market (in millions, except percentages):The following table summarizes net revenue disaggregated by primary geographical market based on destination of shipment (in millions, except percentages): 70Table of ContentsMARVELL TECHNOLOGY, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)These destinations of shipment are not necessarily indicative of the geographic location of the Company’s end customers or the country in which the Company’s end customers sell devices containing the Company’s products. For example, a substantial majority of the shipments made to China relate to sales to non-China based customers that have factories or contract manufacturing operations located within China.The following table summarizes net revenue disaggregated by customer type (in millions, except percentages):Contract LiabilitiesContract liabilities consist of the Company’s obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer for which the Company has received consideration or the amount is due from the customer. Contract liability balances are comprised of deferred revenue. The amount of revenue recognized during the year ended February 1, 2025, that was included in deferred revenue balance at February 3, 2024 was not material.As of the end of a reporting period, some of the performance obligations associated with contracts will have been unsatisfied or only partially satisfied. The Company has elected the practical expedient and does not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts with an original expected duration of one year or less.Customer Warrant During fiscal 2025, the Company issued a warrant to a customer for the purchase of up to 4.2 million shares (“Warrant Shares”) of the Company’s common stock at an exercise price of $87.77 per share. The warrant has an exercise term of seven years and a vesting term of five years. The Warrant Shares vest primarily based on the customer’s achievement of qualifying product revenue milestones and are recognized as a reduction to revenue as qualifying revenues are recognized during the five year vesting term. The grant date fair value of the Warrant was determined to be $54.44 per share and a total fair value of $227.6 million using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. A total of 0.1 million Warrant Shares were vested as of February 1, 2025. See “Note 11 – Equity Compensation and Employee Benefit Plans” for additional information.Sales CommissionsThe Company has elected to apply the practical expedient to expense commissions when incurred as the amortization period is typically one year or less. These costs are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.Note 4 — RestructuringThe Company continuously evaluates its existing operations to increase operational efficiency, decrease costs and increase profitability.The following table provides a summary of restructuring related charges as presented in the consolidated statements of operations (in millions):71Table of ContentsMARVELL TECHNOLOGY, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)The following table presents details related to the restructuring related charges as presented in the consolidated statements of operations (in millions):Fiscal 2025 Plan. A restructuring plan was initiated during the third quarter of fiscal 2025 (the “Fiscal 2025 Plan”) to increase research and development investment in the data center end market and reduce investment in new product development in other end markets including the cancellation of certain future product releases. As a result, the Company was required to assess the recoverability of related long-lived assets. On completion of the assessment, the Company determined the carrying values of certain long-lived assets were not recoverable. The Company utilized a discounted cash flow method of valuation to determine the fair value of the associated assets and liabilities and compared to their carrying values, which resulted in recognition of asset impairment charges for acquired intangible assets, purchased technology licenses, and property and equipment. The Company’s assumptions included future expected revenues, expenses, capital expenditures and other costs, discount rate, and whether or not alternative uses were available for affected assets.The Company recognized $702.7 million of total restructuring and other related charges for the year ended February 1, 2025 related to the Fiscal 2025 Plan. Restructuring charges are mainly comprised of impairment and write-off of acquired intangible assets, purchase technology licenses, inventories, property and equipment and other non-current assets, as well as recognition of future contractual obligations, severance, other one-time termination benefits, and other costs. The restructuring charges include $159.0 million impairment of capitalized purchased technology licenses that the Company had ceased use of in the third quarter of fiscal 2025. In addition, the Company recognized $97.8 million of restructuring charges related to payment obligations associated with impaired technology license agreements. See “Note 8 – Commitments and Contingencies” for additional information. The Company expects these restructuring actions to be substantially completed by the end of fiscal 2026.Fiscal 2024 Plan. A restructuring plan was initiated during the first quarter of fiscal 2024 (the “Fiscal 2024 Plan”) to streamline the organization and optimize resources. Restructuring charges were mainly comprised of severance, other one-time termination benefits, impairment and write-off of purchased technology licenses and equipment, and other costs. The Company recorded restructuring and other related charges of $9.1 million for the year ended February 1, 2025 and $130.8 million for the year ended February 3, 2024 related to the Fiscal 2024 Plan. As of the end of fiscal 2025, substantially all actions relating to the Fiscal 2024 Plan have been completed. Fiscal 2023 Plan. A restructuring plan was initiated during the first quarter of fiscal 2023 (the “Fiscal 2023 Plan”) in order to realign the organization and enable further investment in key priority areas. Restructuring charges are mainly comprised of severance and other one-time termination benefits, facility closures where sites may be redundant within the same region or no longer suitably sized for the local employee base, and other costs. The Company recorded restructuring and other related charges of $15.8 million for the year ended January 28, 2023 related to the Fiscal 2023 Plan. As of the end of fiscal 2025, substantially all actions relating to the Fiscal 2023 Plan have been completed. 72Table of ContentsMARVELL TECHNOLOGY, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)The following table sets forth a reconciliation of the beginning and ending restructuring liability balances by each major type of costs associated with the restructuring charges (in millions):(1)Impairment and other non-cash charges of $526.5 million recognized in fiscal 2025 were recorded directly to the consolidated statements of operations and were not included in the restructuring liability balances above.(2)Includes recognition of restructuring liabilities for future contractual obligations as a result of the cease use of related assets.The current portion of the restructuring liability at February 1, 2025 is comprised of $91.5 million and $9.2 million included as components of accrued liabilities and accounts payable, respectively, and the non-current portion of the restructuring liability is included as a component of other non-current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.Note 5 — Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets, NetGoodwillGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination. There was no activity from acquisitions or divestitures recorded to goodwill in fiscal 2025 and 2024. The carrying value of total goodwill as of February 1, 2025 and February 3, 2024 was $11.6 billion.The Company has identified that its business operates as a single operating segment and as a single reporting unit for the purpose of goodwill impairment testing. The Company’s annual test for goodwill impairment as of the last day of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 did not result in any impairment charge.73Table of ContentsMARVELL TECHNOLOGY, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)Acquired Intangible Assets, NetAs of February 1, 2025 and February 3, 2024, net carrying amounts excluding fully amortized intangible assets are as follows (in millions, except for weighted-average remaining amortization period):The Company regularly assesses the results of its business to determine whether events or circumstances exist that indicate whether the carrying amount of the acquired intangible assets may not be recoverable. During fiscal 2025, impairment charges of $240.1 million related to certain acquired developed technologies intangible assets were recognized as part of restructuring actions. The gross carrying amounts and accumulated amortization of fully impaired intangible assets were excluded from the table above. See “Note 4 – Restructuring” for further information.The intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives, except for certain customer contracts and related relationships, which are amortized using an accelerated method of amortization over the expected customer lives, which more closely align with the pattern of realization of economic benefits expected to be obtained. The in-process research and development (“IPR&D”) will be accounted for as an indefinite-lived intangible asset and will not be amortized until the underlying project reaches technological feasibility and commercial production, at which point, the IPR&D is reclassified as an amortizable acquired intangible asset and amortized over the asset’s estimated useful life. Useful lives for these IPR&D projects are expected to range between 8 to 10 years. In the event the IPR&D is abandoned, the related assets will be written off.Amortization for acquired intangible assets was $1.1 billion during the years ended February 1, 2025, February 3, 2024 and January 28, 2023.74Table of ContentsMARVELL TECHNOLOGY, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)The following table presents the estimated future amortization expense of acquired amortizable intangible assets as of February 1, 2025 (in millions):Note 6 — Fair Value MeasurementsFair value is an exit price representing the amount that would be received in the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability. As a basis for considering such assumptions, the accounting guidance establishes a three-tier value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in the valuation methodologies in measuring fair value:Level 1 — Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.Level 2 — Other inputs that are directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace.Level 3 — Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity.The fair value hierarchy also requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.The Company’s Level 1 assets include marketable equity investments that are classified as other non-current assets and which are valued primarily using quoted market prices. The Company’s Level 2 assets include time deposits, as the market inputs used to value these instruments consist of market yield. In addition, forward contracts and the severance pay fund are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy as the valuation inputs are based on quoted prices and market observable data of similar instruments.The tables below set forth, by level, the Company’s assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis. The tables do not include assets that are measured at historical cost or any basis other than fair value (in millions):75Table of ContentsMARVELL TECHNOLOGY, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)The carrying value of investments in non-marketable equity securities recorded to fair value on a non-recurring basis is adjusted for observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or for impairment. These securities relate to equity investments in privately-held companies. These items measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy because the value is estimated based on valuation methods using the observable transaction price at the transaction date and other unobservable inputs such as volatility, rights and obligations of the securities held. As of February 1, 2025 and February 3, 2024, non-marketable equity investments had a carrying value of $48.2 million and $45.8 million, respectively, and are included in other non-current assets in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.There were no transfers of assets between levels in either fiscal 2025 or 2024.Fair Value of DebtThe Company classified the 2026 Term Loan, 2026 Senior Notes, 2028 Senior Notes, 2029 Senior Notes, 2031 Senior Notes, and 2033 Senior Notes as Level 2 in the fair value measurement hierarchy. The carrying value of the 2026 Term Loan approximates its fair value as the 2026 Term Loan is carried at a market observable interest rate that resets periodically. The estimated aggregate fair value of the unsecured senior notes was $3.4 billion at February 1, 2025 and $3.3 billion at February 3, 2024, and were classified as Level 2 as there are quoted prices from less active markets for the notes. See “Note 7 – Debt” for additional information.76Table of ContentsMARVELL TECHNOLOGY, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)Note 7 — DebtSummary of Borrowings and Outstanding DebtThe following table summarizes the Company’s outstanding debt at February 1, 2025 and February 3, 2024 (in millions):(1)As of February 1, 2025, the current portion of outstanding debt that is due within twelve months includes a portion of the 2026 Term Loan - 5-Year Tranche. The weighted-average interest rate on short-term debt outstanding at February 1, 2025 and February 3, 2024 was 5.785% and 6.830%, respectively.2024 and 2026 Term LoansOn December 7, 2020, the Company entered into a term loan credit agreement with a lending syndicate led by JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A (the “2024 and 2026 Term Loan Agreement”) in order to finance the acquisition of Inphi Corporation (“Inphi”). The 2024 and 2026 Term Loan Agreement provides for borrowings of $1.8 billion consisting of: (i) $875.0 million loan with a 3-year term from the funding date (the “3-Year Tranche Loan”) and (ii) $875.0 million loan with a 5-year term from the funding date (the “5-Year Tranche Loan” and, together with the 3-Year Tranche Loan, the “2024 and 2026 Term Loans”).On April 14, 2023, the Company entered into an amendment to the 2024 and 2026 Term Loan Agreement. The amendment modifies the existing agreement to, among other things, adopt Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) interest rates and conform the maximum leverage ratio financial covenant with the amended and restated revolving credit agreement.The 3-Year Tranche Loan, due on April 19, 2024, which had a remaining principal of $735.0 million, was repaid in full during the quarter ended October 28, 2023.Pursuant to the amended 2024 and 2026 Term Loan Agreement, the 5-Year Tranche Loan has a stated floating interest rate which equates to adjusted term SOFR + 137.5 bps. The effective interest rate for the 5-Year Tranche Loan was 4.912% as of February 1, 2025. The 5-Year Tranche Loan requires scheduled principal payments at the end of each fiscal quarter equal to (i) 1.25% of the aggregate principal amount on the term funding date for the first four full fiscal quarters following the term loan funding date, (ii) 2.50% of the aggregate principal amount on the term funding date for the fifth through twelfth full fiscal quarters following the term loan funding date, and (iii) 3.75% of the aggregate principal amount on the term funding date for each fiscal quarter following the twelfth full fiscal quarter following the term loan funding date.

As of February 1, 2025, the Company has $590.6 million of 5-Year Tranche Loan borrowings outstanding.77Table of ContentsMARVELL TECHNOLOGY, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)The 2024 and 2026 Term Loan Agreement requires that the Company and its subsidiaries comply with covenants relating to customary matters, including with respect to creating or permitting certain liens, entering into sale and leaseback transactions, and consolidating, merging, liquidating or dissolving. It also prohibits subsidiaries of the Company from incurring additional indebtedness, subject to certain exceptions, and requires that the Company maintain a leverage ratio financial covenant as of the end of any fiscal quarter.2023 Revolving Credit FacilityOn December 7, 2020, the Company entered into a revolving line of credit agreement with a lending syndicate led by JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A for borrowings of up to $750.0 million. On April 14, 2023, the Company entered into an agreement to amend and restate the credit facility to increase the borrowing capacity to $1.0 billion (as so amended and restated, the “2023 Revolving Credit Facility”). The 2023 Revolving Credit Facility has a 5-year term and a stated floating interest rate which equates to an adjusted term SOFR plus an applicable margin. The borrowings from the Revolving Loans will be used for general corporate purposes of the Company. The Company may prepay any borrowings at any time without premium or penalty. An unused commitment fee is payable quarterly based on unused balances at a rate that is based on the ratings of the Company’s senior unsecured long-term indebtedness. This annual rate was 0.175% at February 1, 2025.As of February 1, 2025, the 2023 Revolving Credit Facility was undrawn and is available for draw down through April 14, 2028.The 2023 Revolving Credit Facility requires that the Company and its subsidiaries comply with covenants relating to customary matters. The covenants are consistent with the 2024 and 2026 Term Loan Agreement covenants discussed above.As of February 1, 2025, the Company was in compliance with its debt covenants for the credit agreements discussed above.2029 and 2033 Senior Unsecured NotesOn September 18, 2023, the Company completed an offering of (i) $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Company’s 5.750% Senior Notes due 2029 (the “2029 Senior Notes”) and (ii) $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Company’s 5.950% Senior Notes due 2033 (the “2033 Senior Notes”, and, together with the 2029 Senior Notes, the “2029 and 2033 Senior Notes”).The 2029 Senior Notes have a 5.5-year term and mature on February 15, 2029, and the 2033 Senior Notes have a 10-year term and mature on September 15, 2033.

The Company may offer a longer warranty period in limited situations based on product type and negotiated warranty terms with certain customers.CommitmentsThe Company’s commitments primarily consist of wafer purchase obligations with foundry partners, supply capacity reservation payment commitments with foundries and test and assembly partners, technology license fee obligations, and minimum purchase commitments under technology service agreements. Total future unconditional purchase commitments as of February 1, 2025, are as follows (in millions):Technology license fees include the liabilities under agreements for technology licenses between the Company and various vendors.Under the Company’s manufacturing relationships with its foundry partners, cancellation of outstanding purchase orders is allowed but requires payment of all costs and expenses incurred through the date of cancellation, and in some cases, may result in incremental fees, loss of amounts paid in advance, or loss of priority to reserved capacity for a period of time.80Table of ContentsMARVELL TECHNOLOGY, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)The Company entered into manufacturing supply capacity reservation agreements with foundries and test & assembly suppliers during the current and prior fiscal years. Under these arrangements, the Company agreed to pay capacity fees or refundable deposits to the suppliers in exchange for reserved manufacturing production capacity over the term of the agreements, which ranges from 4 to 10 years. In addition, the Company committed to certain purchase levels that were in line with the capacity reserved. During the first and second quarters of fiscal 2025, the Company worked with its foundry and test and assembly suppliers to amend certain manufacturing supply capacity reservation agreements, which resulted in reducing the Company’s related purchase level commitments. The Company currently estimates that it has agreed to purchase level commitments of at least $544.6 million of wafers, substrates, and other manufacturing products for fiscal 2026 through fiscal 2033 under the capacity reservation agreements. In addition, total fees and refundable deposits payable under these arrangements are $47.1 million in fiscal 2026 through fiscal 2028. Such purchase commitments are summarized in the preceding table.In September 2021, the Company entered into a technology licensing agreement with a vendor which provided complete access to the vendor’s intellectual property portfolio for 10 years. The arrangement provided access to intellectual property over the term of the contract, including existing intellectual property, as well as intellectual property in development, and to be developed in the future. The contract provided support and maintenance over the term of the contract as well. In the third quarter of fiscal 2025, the Company ceased use of this arrangement due to restructuring actions taken during the quarter, resulting in recognition of asset impairment charges. See “Note 4 – Restructuring” for further information. Aggregate remaining fees of $268.5 million as of the cease use date are payable quarterly over the contract term.Contingencies and Legal ProceedingsThe Company currently is, and may from time to time become, subject to claims, lawsuits, governmental inquiries, inspections or investigations and other legal proceedings (collectively, “Legal Matters”) arising in the course of its business. Such Legal Matters, even if not meritorious, could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources.During the third quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with a customer in relation to a contractual dispute pursuant to which the Company agreed to pay the customer $100.0 million over several quarters. The amount has been paid in full.As of the end of fiscal 2024, the Company recognized charges of $251.0 million in the aggregate for product related claims, including amounts recognized in previous quarters. Such claims were fully resolved in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024.In the third quarter of fiscal 2025, the Company reserved $50.0 million in relation to a contractual disagreement with a customer that was influenced by the restructuring actions initiated by the Fiscal 2025 Plan. See “Note 4 – Restructuring” for additional information. Subsequent to fiscal 2025 year end, the Company reached an agreement with the customer to resolve the matter, in an amount that was not materially different than previously estimated, as reflected in the accompanying fiscal 2025 consolidated financial statements accordingly. The Company is currently unable to predict the final outcome of its pending Legal Matters and therefore cannot determine the likelihood of loss or estimate a range of possible loss, except with respect to amounts where it has determined a loss is both probable and estimable and has made an accrual. The Company evaluates, at least on a quarterly basis, developments in its Legal Matters that could affect the amount of any accrual, as well as any developments that would result in a loss contingency to become both probable and reasonably estimable. The ultimate outcome of its pending Legal Matters involves judgments, estimates and inherent uncertainties. An unfavorable outcome in a Legal Matter could require the Company to pay damages or could prevent the Company from selling some of its products in certain jurisdictions. While the Company cannot predict with certainty the results of the Legal Matters in which it is currently involved, the Company does not expect that the ultimate costs to resolve these Legal Matters will individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, however, there can be no assurance that the current or any future Legal Matters will be resolved in a manner that is not adverse to the Company’s business, financial statements, results of operations or cash flows.81Table of ContentsMARVELL TECHNOLOGY, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)Indemnities, Commitments and GuaranteesDuring its normal course of business, the Company has made certain indemnities, commitments and guarantees under which it may be required to make payments in relation to certain transactions. These indemnities may include indemnities for general commercial obligations, indemnities to various lessors in connection with facility leases for certain claims arising from such facility or lease, and indemnities to directors and officers of the Company to the maximum extent permitted under the laws of Delaware. In addition, the Company has contractual commitments to various customers, which could require the Company to incur costs to repair an epidemic defect with respect to its products outside of the normal warranty period if such defect were to occur. The duration of these indemnities, commitments and guarantees varies, and in certain cases, is indefinite. Some of these indemnities, commitments and guarantees do not provide for any limitation of the maximum potential future payments that the Company could be obligated to make. In general, the Company does not record any liability for these indemnities, commitments and guarantees in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as the amounts cannot be reasonably estimated and are not considered probable. The Company does, however, accrue for losses for any known contingent liability, including those that may arise from indemnification provisions, when future payment is probable and estimable.Intellectual Property IndemnificationIn addition to the above indemnities, the Company has agreed to indemnify certain customers for claims made against the Company’s products where such claims allege infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, including, but not limited to, patents, registered trademarks, and/or copyrights. Under the aforementioned indemnification clauses, the Company may be obligated to defend the customer and pay for the damages awarded against the customer as well as the attorneys’ fees and costs under an infringement claim. The Company’s indemnification obligations generally do not expire after termination or expiration of the agreement containing the indemnification obligation. Generally, but not always, there are limits on and exceptions to the Company’s potential liability for indemnification. Historically the Company has not made significant payments under these indemnification obligations and the Company cannot estimate the amount of potential future payments, if any, that it might be required to make as a result of these agreements. The maximum potential amount of any future payments that the Company could be required to make under these indemnification obligations could be significant.Note 9 — LeasesThe Company’s leases primarily include facility leases and hosting/data center leases, which are all classified as operating leases. For hosting/data center leases, the Company elected the practical expedient to account for the lease and non-lease component as a single lease component.Lease expense and supplemental cash flow information are as follows (in millions):The effect of operating lease right-of-use asset amortization of $34.3 million, $37.2 million and $32.5 million is included in changes in Other expense, net in the cash provided by operating activities section on the consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended February 1, 2025, February 3, 2024, and January 28, 2023, respectively.82Table of ContentsMARVELL TECHNOLOGY, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)The aggregate future lease payments for operating leases as of February 1, 2025 are as follows (in millions):Average lease terms and discount rates were as follows:Note 10 — Stockholders’ EquityPreferred and Common StockUnder the terms of the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation, the Board of Directors may determine the rights, preferences, and terms of the Company’s authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock.As of February 1, 2025, the Company is authorized to issue 8.0 million shares of $0.002 par value preferred stock and 1.3 billion shares of $0.002 par value common stock.

The stock repurchase program replaced in its entirety the prior $3.3 billion stock repurchase program. On October 16, 2018, the Company announced that its Board of Directors authorized a $700.0 million addition to the balance of its existing stock repurchase program. On March 7, 2024, the Company announced that its Board of Directors authorized a $3.0 billion addition to the balance of its existing stock repurchase program. The Company intends to effect stock repurchases in accordance with the conditions of Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act, but may also make repurchases in the open market outside of Rule 10b-18 or in privately negotiated transactions. The stock repurchase program is subject to market conditions, legal rules and regulations, and other factors, and does not obligate the Company to repurchase any dollar amount or number of shares of its common stock and the repurchase program may be extended, modified, suspended or discontinued at any time. The Company repurchased 9.0 million shares of its common stock for $725.0 million during fiscal 2025, 2.5 million shares of its common stock for $150.0 million during fiscal 2024 and 2.3 million shares of its common stock for $115.0 million during fiscal 2023. The repurchased shares of stock were retired immediately after the repurchases were completed. The Company records all repurchases, as well as investment purchases and sales, based on their trade date. As of February 1, 2025, a total of 321.9 million shares of stock have been repurchased to date under the Company’s stock repurchase program for a total $5.3 billion in cash and there was $2.6 billion remaining available for future stock repurchases.Subsequent to fiscal 2025 year end through March 11, 2025, the Company repurchased 0.7 million shares of its common stock for $45.0 million.A summary of the stock repurchase activity under the stock repurchase program, reported based on the trade date, is summarized as follows (in millions, except per share amounts):Note 11 — Equity Compensation and Employee Benefit PlansEmployee Stock Compensation Plans1995 Stock Option PlanIn April 1995, the Company adopted the 1995 Stock Option Plan (the “Option Plan”). The Option Plan, as amended from time to time, had 383.4 million shares of common stock reserved for issuance thereunder as of February 1, 2025. As of February 1, 2025, approximately 46.0 million shares remained available for future grants under the Option Plan. Under the Option Plan, the Company may issue restricted stock unit (“RSU”) awards, performance-based restricted stock unit (“PRSU”) awards, stock options, and other types of stock awards, all of which may be subject to vesting over a specified service term, generally three to four years.RSUs granted under the Option Plan include time-based RSUs and PRSUs. Time-based RSUs generally vest over a three to four-year service period. The Company grants PRSUs that vest based on the achievement of performance metrics, which can be financial performance, non-financial performance, and/or market conditions, including, but not limited to, the Company’s relative total shareholder return, earnings per share growth, and stock price performance. PRSU awards reflect a target number of shares, and the actual number of shares may range from 0% to 250% based on the achievement of the performance metrics specified. In addition to achievement of performance and/or market conditions, PRSUs generally have a three to five year service requirement.84Table of ContentsMARVELL TECHNOLOGY, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)Options granted under the Option Plan generally have a term of 10 years and must be issued at prices equal to the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant. Options generally vest over a three to four-year service period.In December 2017, the Company’s Executive Compensation Committee approved a deferred stock program, whereby executives of the Company have the option, beginning in 2018, to defer the settlement of time-based and performance-based restricted stock units granted under the Option Plan to a future date. In June 2021, the Company extended the stock deferral program to members of the Board of Directors. A deferral election is irrevocable after the annual submission deadline. The shares of common stock underlying the deferred grants will be distributed at the earliest of the employee’s specified future settlement date or upon separation from service, a change in control, or death or disability.Outside Director Equity Compensation PolicyIn September 2016, the Company’s Board of Directors approved an Outside Director Equity Compensation Policy that governs the grant of equity awards to non-employee directors under the Option Plan. Under the current Outside Director Compensation Policy, each outside director, upon appointment to fill a vacancy on the board or in connection with election at an annual meeting of stockholders, will be granted an RSU award under the Option Plan. The RSU award vests 100% on the earlier of the date of the next annual meeting of stockholders or the one-year anniversary of the date of grant.Assumed Employee Stock Compensation Plans In connection with past acquisitions, the Company assumed equity incentive plans of certain acquired companies (collectively “the Assumed Plans”), and the equity awards assumed in connection with each acquisition were granted from their respective assumed plans. The assumed equity awards will be settled in shares of the Company’s common stock and will retain the terms and conditions under which they were originally granted. No additional equity awards will be granted under the Assumed Plans. Employee Stock Purchase PlanUnder the 2000 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as amended and restated on June 23, 2022 (the “ESPP”), participants purchase the Company’s common stock using payroll deductions, which may not exceed 15% of their total cash compensation. The ESPP provides for a 24-month offering period, with four six-month purchase periods. Participants are granted the right to purchase common stock at a price per share that is 85% of the lesser of the fair market value of the common stock at (i) the participant’s enrollment date into the two-year offering period or (ii) the end of each six-month purchase period within the offering period.Under the ESPP, a total of 2.3 million shares were issued in fiscal 2025 at a weighted-average price of $36.34 per share, a total of 2.4 million shares were issued in fiscal 2024 at a weighted-average price of $35.57 per share, and a total of 2.3 million shares were issued in fiscal 2023 at a weighted-average price of $37.52 per share. As of February 1, 2025, there was $68.3 million of unamortized compensation expense related to the ESPP.As of February 1, 2025, approximately 39.2 million shares remained available for future issuance under the ESPP.Summary of Stock-Based Compensation ExpenseThe following table summarizes stock-based compensation expense (in millions):The income tax benefit recognized from stock-based compensation expense was $92.2 million, $95.3 million and $89.9 million for the years ended February 1, 2025, February 3, 2024 and January 28, 2023, respectively. Stock-based compensation capitalized in inventory was $16.6 million at February 1, 2025, $18.2 million at February 3, 2024 and $20.3 million at January 28, 2023.85Table of ContentsMARVELL TECHNOLOGY, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)The income tax benefit related to equity awards vested or exercised was $58.5 million, $24.3 million and $21.7 million during the years ended February 1, 2025, February 3, 2024 and January 28, 2023, respectively.Restricted Stock and Stock Unit AwardsA summary of restricted stock and stock unit activity for time-based and performance-based awards is as follows (in millions, except per share amounts):The aggregate intrinsic value of RSUs vested and expected to vest as of February 1, 2025 was $1.4 billion. The weighted-average grant date fair value for RSUs granted was $69.93, $41.50 and $55.73 for the years ended February 1, 2025, February 3, 2024 and January 28, 2023, respectively. The total fair value of RSUs vested during the years ended February 1, 2025, February 3, 2024 and January 28, 2023 was $491.6 million, $523.7 million and $519.6 million, respectively. As of February 1, 2025, unamortized compensation expense related to RSUs was $658.7 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.8 years.The aggregate intrinsic value of PRSUs vested and expected to vest as of February 1, 2025 was $576.0 million. The weighted-average grant date fair value for PRSUs granted was $72.61, $37.78 and $45.40 for the years ended February 1, 2025, February 3, 2024 and January 28, 2023, respectively.

As of February 1, 2025, unamortized compensation expense related to PRSUs was $143.1 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.5 years.Warrant SharesDuring fiscal 2025, the Company issued a warrant to a customer for the purchase of up to 4.2 million shares (“Warrant Shares”) of the Company’s common stock at an exercise price of $87.77 per share. The warrant has an exercise term of 7 years and a vesting term of 5 years. See “Note 3 – Revenue” for additional information.Activity for the Warrant Shares is as follows (in millions):A total of 0.1 million Warrant Shares were vested as of February 1, 2025. Valuation of Stock-Based AwardsThe expected volatility for awards granted during fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023 was based on historical stock price volatility.The expected dividend yield is calculated by dividing the current annualized dividend by the closing stock price on the date of grant of the option or award.86Table of ContentsMARVELL TECHNOLOGY, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)The following weighted-average assumptions were used for each respective period to calculate the fair value of common stock to be issued under the ESPP on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model:The following weighted-average assumptions were used for each respective period to calculate the fair value of common stock to be issued under PRSU awards on the date of grant using the Monte Carlo pricing model:The correlation coefficients are calculated based upon the price data used to calculate the historical volatilities and is used to model the way in which each entity tends to move in relation to its peers.The following assumptions were used for each respective period to calculate the fair value of Warrant Shares on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model:Employee 401(k) PlansThe Company sponsors a 401(k) savings and investment plan that allows eligible U.S. employees to participate by making pre-tax, Roth and after-tax contributions to the 401(k) plan ranging from 1% to 75% of eligible earnings subject to a required annual limit. The Company currently matches 100% of 5% of eligible salary to a $5,000 maximum contribution effective from January 1, 2023. The Company made matching contributions to employees of $14.7 million in fiscal 2025, $15.5 million in fiscal 2024 and $15.9 million in fiscal 2023. As of February 1, 2025, the 401(k) plan offers a variety of investment alternatives, representing different asset classes. Employees may not invest in the Company’s common stock through the 401(k) plan.The Company also has voluntary defined contribution plans in various non-U.S. locations. In connection with these plans, the Company made contributions on behalf of employees totaling $11.0 million, $11.4 million and $11.3 million during fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively.87Table of ContentsMARVELL TECHNOLOGY, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)Note 12 — Income TaxesThe U.S. and non-U.S. components of income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes consist of the following (in millions):The provision (benefit) for income taxes consists of the following (in millions):The income tax expense (benefit) differs from the amount computed by applying the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% to income (loss) before income taxes as follows (in millions):88Table of ContentsMARVELL TECHNOLOGY, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)The income tax benefit for fiscal 2025 differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% as a result of foreign income inclusions in the U.S., a portion of the Company’s earnings or losses being taxed or benefited at rates lower than the U.S. statutory rate, research and development credit generation, and deductions related to stock compensation.The income tax expense for fiscal 2024 differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% as a result of foreign income inclusions in the U.S., a portion of the Company’s earnings or losses being taxed or benefited at rates lower than the U.S. statutory rate, research and development credit generation, and disallowed deductions related to non-deductible compensation. Further, during fiscal 2024, guidance was issued by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service in connection with the capitalization of research and development expenditures. As a result of this guidance, certain costs are currently deductible rather than capitalizable, which resulted in a reduction to the Company’s income tax payable and an increase in its deferred tax assets for which the Company maintains a full valuation allowance.The income tax expense for fiscal 2023 differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to the remeasurement of Singapore deferred taxes upon extension of the Company’s tax incentive in Singapore, tax benefits attributable to a net reduction of unrecognized tax benefits as a result of settled income tax audits in combination with the lapsing of statute of limitations, offset by foreign income inclusions in the U.S., and a tax expense related to the recapture of certain Israel corporate income taxes. The income tax expense for fiscal 2023 is also impacted by a substantial portion of the Company’s earnings, or in some cases, losses being taxed or benefited at rates lower than the U.S. statutory rate, stock-based compensation tax benefits, and disallowed deductions related to non-deductible compensation.Deferred tax assets and liabilities consist of the following (in millions):The deferred taxes reflected above for fiscal 2025 include the impact of the Fiscal 2025 Plan, which resulted in a reversal of deferred tax liabilities associated with acquired intangible assets.The deferred tax assets and liabilities based on tax jurisdictions are presented on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets as follows (in millions):89Table of ContentsMARVELL TECHNOLOGY, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those assets become deductible or creditable. The Company evaluates the recoverability of its deferred tax assets, weighing all positive and negative evidence, and provides or maintains a valuation allowance for these assets if it is more likely than not that some, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. If negative evidence exists, sufficient positive evidence is necessary to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed. The Company considers all available evidence such as its earnings history including the existence of cumulative income or losses, reversals of taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies. In the U.S., and in certain foreign jurisdictions, the Company has deferred tax assets for which partial valuation allowances have been established. After weighing all available evidence, particularly the earnings history and forecasts of future taxable income in each respective jurisdiction, as well as its history of tax credits expiring unused, the Company determined that negative evidence outweighed positive evidence with respect to the ability to realize federal, state, and foreign research and development and other tax credits, as well as certain other foreign deferred tax assets. The valuation allowance increased by $77.2 million from fiscal 2024, for certain federal, state, and foreign tax attributes. The Company maintains a valuation allowance on its U.S. R&D credits based on the factors listed above as well as forecasted R&D credit utilization and expected R&D credit generation in future years. In future periods, it is possible that significant positive or negative evidence could arise that results in a change in the Company’s judgment with respect to the need for a valuation allowance, which could result in a tax benefit, or adversely affect the Company’s income tax provision, in the period of such change in judgment.As of February 1, 2025, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards available to offset future taxable income of approximately $476.1 million, $808.9 million, $262.9 million and $1.2 million for U.S. federal, state of California, other U.S. states, and foreign purposes, respectively. If not utilized, the federal loss carryforwards begin to expire in fiscal 2033, and the California carryforwards begin to expire in fiscal 2027. The majority of the Company’s foreign losses carry forward indefinitely. The Company also had federal research and other tax credit carryforwards of approximately $714.0 million, which begin to expire in fiscal 2027. As of February 1, 2025, the Company also had California research tax credit carryforwards of approximately $731.2 million, which can be carried forward indefinitely. In addition, the Company has research and other tax credit carryforwards of approximately $48.2 million in other U.S. states, which begin to expire in fiscal 2026. The Company also has research and other tax credit carryforwards of approximately $10.8 million in foreign jurisdictions, which begin to expire in fiscal 2027. The Company’s net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to audit and adjusted for changes or modification in tax laws, other authoritative interpretations, or other facts and circumstances.Utilization of the Company’s U.S. federal and state net operating loss and credit carryforwards may be subject to annual limitations due to ownership change provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and similar state provisions. The annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits before utilization. Future changes in the Company’s stock ownership, some of which are generally outside of the Company’s control, could result in an ownership change under Section 382 and Section 383 and result in a limitation on U.S. tax attributes. The Company has determined that no significant limitation would be placed on the utilization of its net operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards due to prior ownership changes.The following table reflects changes in the unrecognized tax benefits (in millions):The Company has recorded $541.7 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits as of February 1, 2025, of which $207.0 million would affect the Company’s effective income tax rate if recognized. $489.6 million of the Company’s gross unrecognized tax benefits as of February 1, 2025 relate to income tax positions which, if recognized, would increase deferred tax assets that are subject to valuation allowances.90Table of ContentsMARVELL TECHNOLOGY, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)The total amount of interest and penalties accrued was approximately $5.8 million, $3.8 million, and $3.2 million as of February 1, 2025, February 3, 2024, and January 28, 2023, respectively. The consolidated statements of operations for fiscal 2025, 2024, and 2023 included accruals of $2.5 million, $1.3 million, and $1.6 million, respectively, of interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits.The Company’s major tax jurisdictions are the United States, the states of California and Massachusetts, Germany, India, Israel and Singapore. The Company is subject to income tax audits by the respective tax authorities in all of the jurisdictions in which it operates. The examination of tax liabilities in each of these jurisdictions requires the interpretation and application of complex and sometimes uncertain tax laws and regulations. As of February 1, 2025, the Company is subject to examination in significant jurisdictions including Germany, India, Israel, Singapore, and the United States for fiscal 2003 through 2025.During the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits could increase or decrease significantly due to changes in tax law in various jurisdictions, new tax audits and changes in the U.S. dollar as compared to foreign currencies within the next 12 months. Excluding these factors, the Company does not expect a significant decrease to its uncertain tax positions as a result of the lapse of the statutes of limitations in various jurisdictions during the next 12 months.The Company maintains a Development and Expansion Incentive (“DEI”) in Singapore through June 30, 2029. To retain the current DEI tax benefits through June 2029 in Singapore, the Company must meet certain operating conditions, headcount and investment requirements, as well as maintain certain activities in Singapore. In fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, no Singapore tax incentive net tax benefits were recorded.Marvell Israel (M.I.S.L) Ltd., is entitled to certain tax benefits through December 31, 2026 under the Israeli Encouragement of Investments Law (“Encouragement Law”) Special Technology Enterprise Regime, subject to various operating requirements and other conditions. In fiscal 2025, no Israel tax incentive net tax benefits were recorded. In fiscal 2024, tax savings associated with this program were approximately $8.7 million, which if paid, would impact the Company’s earnings per share by $0.01 per share. In fiscal 2023, tax savings associated with this program were approximately $11.2 million, which if paid, would impact the Company’s earnings per share by $0.01 per share.The Company’s principal source of liquidity as of February 1, 2025 consisted of approximately $948.3 million of cash and cash equivalents, of which approximately $716.9 million was held by subsidiaries outside of the United States. In addition, the Company has an undrawn revolving credit facility of $1.0 billion. The Company has not recognized a deferred tax liability on $301.2 million of assets held by subsidiaries as such amounts are deemed to be indefinitely reinvested. The Company manages its worldwide cash requirements by, among other things, reviewing available funds held by its foreign subsidiaries and the cost effectiveness by which those funds can be accessed in the United States.Note 13 — Net Loss Per ShareThe Company reports both basic net loss per share, which is based on the weighted-average number of common stock outstanding during the period, and diluted net loss per share, which is based on the weighted-average number of common stock outstanding and potentially dilutive shares outstanding during the period.91Table of ContentsMARVELL TECHNOLOGY, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)The computations of basic and diluted net loss per share are presented in the following table (in millions, except per share amounts):Potential dilutive securities include dilutive common stock from stock-based awards attributable to the assumed exercise of stock options, restricted stock units, employee stock purchase plan shares and warrant shares using the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, potential common stock outstanding are not included in the computation of diluted net income per share, if their effect is anti-dilutive.Anti-dilutive potential shares are presented in the following table (in millions):Anti-dilutive potential shares from stock-based awards are excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share for all periods reported above because either their exercise price exceeded the average market price during the period or the stock-based awards were determined to be anti-dilutive based on applying the treasury stock method. Anti-dilutive potential shares from stock-based awards and warrant shares are excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share for the years ended February 1, 2025, February 3, 2024, and January 28, 2023 due to the net losses reported in those periods.Note 14 — Segment and Geographic InformationThe Company operates in one reportable segment — the design, development and sale of integrated circuits. The chief executive officer was identified as the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”). Based on his direct involvement with the Company’s operations and product development, the CODM is ultimately responsible for and actively involved in the allocation of resources and the assessment of the Company’s performance using consolidated net income (loss) reported on the consolidated statements of operations. The Company’s organizational structure is based along functional lines, with each of the functional department heads, as well as shared resources, reporting directly to the CODM or to a direct report of the CODM. The Company uses a highly-integrated approach in developing its products in that discrete technologies developed by the Company are frequently integrated across many of its products, and substantially all of the Company’s integrated circuits are manufactured under similar manufacturing processes. Accordingly, the Company operates under a single operating segment.92Table of ContentsMARVELL TECHNOLOGY, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)The following table presents a summary of consolidated net loss inclusive of significant segment expenses and other expense information provided to the CODM (in millions):(a)Includes material, labor and other product related costs, excluding the other categories above.(b)Restructuring related charges of $357.9 million are included in cost of goods sold and $353.9 million are included in operating expenses for the year ended February 1, 2025 in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.(c)Includes depreciation and amortization expenses, facilities expenses, legal expenses, interest income and other income and expenses.This expense information is based on management's internal view of expense classification when reviewing aspects of financial and operating performance of the business, and may not be representative of expense classification that is comparable to other peer companies' internal management views. As a result, this expense information should not be considered in isolation or as substitute for analysis of Marvell’s results in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto.

The Company accounts for these transactions as sales of receivables and presents cash proceeds as cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. After the sale of its trade accounts receivable, the Company will collect payment from the customer and remit it to the third-party financial institution. Total trade accounts receivable sold under the factoring arrangement were $868.8 million for the year ended February 1, 2025, of which $101.8 million remained subject to servicing by the Company as of February 1, 2025. Total trade accounts receivable sold under the factoring arrangement were $335.7 million for the year ended February 3, 2024, of which $155.9 million remained subject to servicing by the Company as of February 3, 2024. Factoring fees for the sales of receivables were recorded in interest income and other, net and were not material for fiscal 2025 and 2024.The Company recorded depreciation expense for property and equipment of $177.0 million, $148.2 million and $126.8 million for fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively.94Table of ContentsMARVELL TECHNOLOGY, INC.NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)(1)Amortization of technology licenses was $125.5 million, $177.1 million and $189.5 million in fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Controls and ProceduresManagement’s Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and ProceduresManagement, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of February 1, 2025. Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of February 1, 2025.Management has concluded that the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K present fairly, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial ReportingManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Internal control over financial reporting consists of policies and procedures that: (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (2) are designed and operated to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and our process for the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Our internal control over financial reporting is designed by, and under the supervision of the principal executive officer and principal financial officer and effected by the Company’s Board of Directors, management, and others. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of February 1, 2025 using the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting as described in “Internal Control-Integrated Framework,” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organization of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO Criteria). Based on this assessment, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of February 1, 2025.The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of February 1, 2025 has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report that is included herein.97Table of ContentsInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of ControlsOur management, including our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.Changes to Internal Control over Financial ReportingNo change in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) occurred during the three months ended February 1, 2025 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.Item 9B. Other InformationIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, the following trading plans intended to satisfy the Rule 10b5-1 affirmative defense pursuant to Item 408(a)(1) of Regulation S-K were adopted or terminated by an executive officer or director of the Company:(1)Vesting of future performance shares are estimated based on target achievement.(2)If the plan covers "net" vested shares, then the current tax rate has been applied.Item 9C. Disclosure Regarding Foreign Jurisdictions that Prevent InspectionsNot applicable.98Table of ContentsREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRMTo the stockholders and the Board of Directors of Marvell Technology, Inc.Opinion on Internal Control over Financial ReportingWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Marvell Technology, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of February 1, 2025, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of February 1, 2025, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended February 1, 2025, of the Company and our report dated March 12, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.Basis for OpinionThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial ReportingA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate./s/ Deloitte & Touche LLPSan Jose, CaliforniaMarch 12, 2025 99Table of ContentsPART IIIUnless we file an amendment to this Form 10-K within 120 days after February 1, 2025 to include the Part III information, we intend to incorporate such information by reference to our definitive proxy statement in connection with our 2025 annual meeting of stockholders to be held in June 2025 (the “2025 Proxy Statement”).Item 10.     Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate GovernanceThe information required by Items 401, 407(c)(3) and 408(b) of Regulation S-K with respect to our directors, director nominees, executive officers and corporate governance is incorporated by reference herein to the information set forth under the captions “Election of Directors,” “Corporate Governance and Matters Related to Our Board,” “Executive Officers of the Company” and “Insider Trading, Anti-Hedging and Anti-Pledging Policies” in our 2025 Proxy Statement.
