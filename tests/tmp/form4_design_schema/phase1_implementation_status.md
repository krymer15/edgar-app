# Phase 1: Security Normalization Implementation (COMPLETED)

This document summarizes the implementation status of Phase 1 of the Form 4 schema redesign: Security Normalization. 

## Implementation Status

### Completed Components

1. **Database Tables**: ✅
   - Created the `securities` table for normalized security information
   - Created the `derivative_securities` table for derivative-specific details
   - Added appropriate constraints and indexes

2. **ORM Models**: ✅
   - Implemented `Security` model in `models/orm_models/forms/security_orm.py`
   - Implemented `DerivativeSecurity` model in `models/orm_models/forms/derivative_security_orm.py`
   - Set up proper relationships between models

3. **Dataclasses**: ✅
   - Created `SecurityData` in `models/dataclasses/forms/security_data.py`
   - Created `DerivativeSecurityData` in `models/dataclasses/forms/derivative_security_data.py`
   - Implemented validation logic in __post_init__ methods

4. **Adapters**: ✅
   - Implemented adapter functions in `models/adapters/security_adapter.py`
   - Provided bi-directional conversion between dataclasses and ORM models

5. **Service Layer**: ✅
   - Created `SecurityService` in `services/forms/security_service.py`
   - Implemented security creation, retrieval, and search functionality
   - Added specialized methods for derivative securities

6. **Testing**: ✅
   - Implemented mock-based unit tests for the service layer

### Notes for Implementation

- The implementation uses SQLAlchemy 2.0 patterns, using the appropriate import paths (e.g., `from sqlalchemy.orm import declarative_base`).
- No data migration was performed as we're starting with fresh tables. When ready for production, you may want to revisit the migration scripts.

## Next Phase: Transaction Table Migration (Phase 2)

Based on the pragmatic schema design, Phase 2 will focus on:

1. **Transaction Tables Creation**:
   - Create `non_derivative_transactions` table
   - Create `derivative_transactions` table
   - Establish relationships to securities tables

2. **Transaction Models**:
   - Implement ORM models for both transaction types
   - Create dataclasses for transaction data
   - Develop adapter functions for conversion

3. **Transaction Service**:
   - Build a service for transaction management
   - Implement CRUD operations for transactions
   - Add specialized query methods

4. **Integration**:
   - Begin updating the Form4Writer to use new security and transaction models
   - Implement a transition strategy to support both old and new schemas during migration

### Sequence of Phase 2 Implementation

1. First implement transaction ORM models and tables
2. Next implement transaction dataclasses and adapters
3. Build the transaction service layer
4. Create unit tests for transaction functionality
5. Update documentation

A more detailed implementation plan for Phase 2 will be provided in a separate document.

## Deferred Work

The following aspects were intentionally deferred to future phases:

1. **Position Tracking**: Will be addressed in Phase 3
2. **Form4Writer Integration**: Partially addressed in Phase 2, completed in Phase 4
3. **Legacy Data Migration**: Not required for this implementation as we're starting fresh
