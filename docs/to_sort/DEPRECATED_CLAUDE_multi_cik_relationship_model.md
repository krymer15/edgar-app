# Multi-CIK Relationship Models for SEC Filings

Let's think more deeply about the relationship models for multi-CIK filing form types, focusing particularly on the owner-issuer relationships that are common in Form 4 filings.

## Key Points to Consider

1. Some form types (like Form 4) naturally involve multiple CIKs in different roles  
2. The relationships between these entities are important data  
3. We need a flexible schema that can handle various relationship types  
4. We need to preserve the ability to query efficiently across relationships  

## For Form 4 Specifically

- One issuer company (the entity whose securities are being traded)  
- One or more reporting owners (insiders who are trading the securities)  
- Each owner may have multiple roles (director, officer, 10% owner)  
- Each filing may contain multiple transactions for the same owner  

---

## Entity-Relationship Model

### Core Entities

1. **Companies/Entities** (issuers and owners alike)  
2. **People** (individual reporting owners)  
3. **Filings** (the Form 4 submissions)  
4. **Relationships** (connections between entities/people and roles)  
5. **Transactions** (actual security trades)  

### Relationship Types

- **Issuer → Securities** (company issues securities)  
- **Person → Company** (person works for/is affiliated with company)  
- **Company → Company** (company owns shares of another company)  
- **Owner → Securities** (owner trades securities)

## Database Schema Design

### 1. Universal Entity Registry

```sql
CREATE TABLE entities (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    cik TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    entity_type ENUM('company', 'person', 'trust', 'group') NOT NULL,
    last_updated TIMESTAMP NOT NULL
);
```

### 2. Relationship Schema (Form 4 Example)

```sql
CREATE TABLE form4_relationships (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    filing_id UUID REFERENCES form4_filings(id),
    issuer_entity_id UUID REFERENCES entities(id),
    owner_entity_id UUID REFERENCES entities(id),
    relationship_type ENUM('director', 'officer', '10_percent_owner', 'other') NOT NULL,
    relationship_details JSONB, -- Stores officer title, footnote references, etc.
    is_group_filing BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    filing_date DATE NOT NULL
);
```

### 3. Transaction Bridge Tables

```sql
CREATE TABLE form4_transactions (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    filing_id UUID REFERENCES form4_filings(id),
    relationship_id UUID REFERENCES form4_relationships(id),
    transaction_type TEXT NOT NULL,
    security_title TEXT NOT NULL,
    -- Other transaction fields
    CONSTRAINT unique_transaction UNIQUE(filing_id, relationship_id, transaction_type)
);
```

## Implementation Advantages

1. **Entity Deduplication**: Stores each entity (person/company) once regardless of role  
2. **Relationship Flexibility**: Properly models M:N relationships between entities  
3. **Historical Tracking**: Can track relationship changes over time  
4. **Efficient Queries**: Enables powerful graph-like queries:
   - "Show all companies where person X is a director"
   - "List all insider transactions for issuer Y"
   - "Identify group filings involving multiple reporting owners"

This architecture creates a foundation for sophisticated relationship analysis across all form types while maintaining clean separation of concerns in the codebase.

# Original prompt and context for the above recommendation generated by Claude Code:

  Let's think more deeply about the relationship models for multi-CIK filing form types, focusing particularly on the owner-issuer
  relationships that are common in Form 4 filings.

  Key points to consider:
  1. Some form types (like Form 4) naturally involve multiple CIKs in different roles
  2. The relationships between these entities are important data
  3. We need a flexible schema that can handle various relationship types
  4. We need to preserve the ability to query efficiently across relationships

  For Form 4 specifically:
  - One issuer company (the entity whose securities are being traded)
  - One or more reporting owners (insiders who are trading the securities)
  - Each owner may have multiple roles (director, officer, 10% owner)
  - Each filing may contain multiple transactions for the same owner

  Let's design a comprehensive model for these relationships:

  Entity-Relationship Model

  Core Entities

  1. Companies/Entities (issuers and owners alike)
  2. People (individual reporting owners)
  3. Filings (the Form 4 submissions)
  4. Relationships (connections between entities/people and roles)
  5. Transactions (actual security trades)

  Relationship Types

  - Issuer → Securities (company issues securities)
  - Person → Company (person works for/is affiliated with company)
  - Company → Company (company owns shares of another company)
  - Owner → Securities (owner trades securities)
