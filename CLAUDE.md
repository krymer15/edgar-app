# Workflow
- Be sure to check for the latest code in an entire module before implementing code changes
- Prefer running single tests, and not the whole test suite, for performance
- Comment code where applicable and generate or update README.md files in folders that may require more context or understanding
- Use `pytest` for unit testing
- Consider current folder structure and naming conventions when making code changes or creating new code or modules
- Include Docstrings and code comments whenever additional context may be helpful
- Request permission to add, commit and push to git after implementation milestones or significant code changes
- Address each issue one by one when working through code changes


# Code style
- Use ES modules (import/export) syntax, not CommonJS (require)
- Destructure imports when possible (eg. import { foo } from 'bar')
